Trump Meets Freedom Caucus and Result Is Legislative Disaster.
During one of his frequent visits to the White House in recent days, Representative Mark Meadows listened to Donald Trump talk about a tote-board he uses to track his presidential campaign promises.

It included the one Meadows was there to talk about, repealing Obamacare. Trump made clear to the head of the House Freedom Caucus that he’s been going down that board, checking off each promise on the list -- and that he wanted to cross this one off too, so he could move on to a tax overhaul and others.

Except it wasn’t that simple. House leaders abruptly scrapped a planned vote on repeal Friday because not enough support materialized, largely due to Meadows’s Freedom Caucus, made up of Congress’s most rebellious conservative members.

For Trump, it was a taste of the anti-establishment fury that propelled him to the White House, delivered by a band of Republican lawmakers who’d rather defy the president than compromise on their conservative ideals.

Put simply, Trump underestimated them, failing to appreciate their determination to block legislation they considered a politically dubious half-measure, even if doing so humiliated Trump, lawmakers and conservative activists said.

“Members of the Freedom Caucus are committed to their constituents and their conservative values. If President Trump was not aware of their resolve before, he is now,” said Alice Stewart, who was a strategist on Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign.

Turning to Taxes

There’s no evidence the group is prepared to fall in line any more easily behind Trump’s next legislation target, the first comprehensive tax overhaul in 30 years. The group’s roughly 40 members are strong believers in low taxes and small government, and also want to rein in entitlements and slash the deficit, two things Trump has never made a priority.

"For the good of our country, I want to see President Trump and his agenda succeed," said Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, a leading group member who complained the leaders’ bill left too much of Obamacare in place. But in the same statement, Brat said, "My promise to my constituents remains the same: I will always follow my principles, work toward good policy, and listen to my constituents."


What’s surprising to some analysts is that anyone can still be surprised. Conservatives who were later to form into the Freedom Caucus pushed for the government shutdown in 2013 over the objections of House leaders. It’s the group that ran off former Speaker John Boehner after finding him too willing to compromise with Democrats. And now it’s the catalyst behind the deal of Trump’s hoped-for health overhaul.

“They’re friends of mine,” Trump said of the caucus on Friday, after House Speaker Paul Ryan had pulled the bill from the floor. “I’m disappointed because we could have had it. I’m a little surprised, to be honest with you.”

Trump displayed some frustration with the group Friday morning, before the bill collapsed, in a tweet from his personal account.

“The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!” he said. Now that frustration has bled over to some in the House Republican conference, who say the group abandoned Trump at a critical moment and is too lashed to its rigid ideology.

‘Freedom Caucus rate hike’

Representative Chris Collins of New York, a close Trump ally, has said the group should disband and fold itself back into a larger conservative caucus, the Republican Study Committee. Representative Austin Scott of Georgia suggested that if health insurance premiums rise as a result of the House bill’s failure, the Freedom Caucus would be to blame.

“Get ready for the Freedom Caucus rate hike,” he said.

Trump might be forgiven for thinking the group would be a surefire "yes." Nearly all came from congressional districts Trump carried overwhelmingly. Many backed his campaign.

Indeed, roughly half of the Freedom Caucus members were ready to sign on to the Obamacare repeal bill. The other half still thought it didn’t go nearly far enough. Meadows and other members picked up on Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul’s saddling of the bill with a label that probably helped doom it: "Obamacare Lite."

For the bill’s supporters, it was a promising enough start. Representative Dave Schweikert of Arizona said he was proud to have voted to advance the measure out of the Ways and Means Committee, and praised it as a move to dismantle Obamacare’s "damaging taxes and mandates" so states could deliver better, more affordable health options.

Schweikert’s Arizona colleague, Representative Trent Franks, also came to support the measure, although he wasn’t happy about the limitations placed on the bill to conform with Senate rules.

But Brat, who said the bill didn’t go far enough to undo Obamacare’s regulations on insurance companies, was among others who weren’t ready to support it. He said Saturday, "The initial construction of this bill kept the structure and architecture of Obamacare fully in place."

Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan of Ohio stuck to his insistence that Congress needed to first pass a complete, clean repeal of Obamacare, and then get to work on devising a replacement. After the bill was pulled, he said, "Now, House Republicans owe it to our constituents to immediately get back to the drawing board and bring forward a bolder effort to replace the failing Obamacare with a plan to reduce costs by increasing choice and competition."

White House Meetings

It wasn’t that Trump didn’t try to get support from the Freedom Caucus. He invited the group to the White House several times -- and more importantly, asked its members to offer suggestions to improve the bill. (Trump made the same offer to the moderate "Tuesday Group" of House Republicans, at a time when Ryan was trying to rally support behind the existing bill.)

The negotiating intensified between the White House and the group in the last week, and the Freedom Caucus members said the talks were productive, but complained about Ryan’s Thursday time line for a vote as arbitrary and rushed.

After Trump visited Capitol Hill Tuesday, he brought some members of the group to the White House Wednesday, prompting Meadows to return to the Capitol and tell reporters he was "cautiously optimistic."   Even as he went into a meeting with fellow caucus members to describe the developments, he says Trump personally called him on his cellphone to talk some more.

Meadows had won a big concession from the president -- the bill would be changed to strip out Obamacare’s requirements that health insurers provide a set of essential health benefits. But the last-minute change wasn’t quite enough for the Freedom Caucus holdouts, but went too far for some wavering moderates, who declared their opposition the next day.

After another meeting Thursday with some members of the caucus and the president, there was still no deal, and Ryan’s plan to vote that day, on the seventh anniversary of Obamacare being signed into law, was put off. A last-ditch meeting Friday with Vice President Mike Pence, who served 12 years in the House, also failed to break the logjam. And the bill was pulled, 30 minutes before the scheduled vote.

Conservative groups place some of the blame on Ryan, who has generally had good relations with the group after working early on to give them more say in Republican matters than Boehner did and more freedom to bring bills to the floor.

But in this case, the Freedom Caucus was only looped in after the bill was introduced and an avalanche of criticism already had mounted on the right, making it more difficult for the group to get on board.

Wide Opposition

The bill achieved the rare feat of uniting Democrats and Republicans on both ideological ends of their party in opposition. Moderate Republicans worried that the legislation would leave too many Americans without coverage and drive up insurance premiums.

The Congressional Budget Office said that about 24 million Americans would lose or drop their insurance coverage over a decade, at a savings of about $150 billion to the federal government.

Miscalculating the depth of the Freedom Caucus’s opposition leaves Trump’s ambitious agenda in jeopardy. Congressional leaders had maintained that they must tackle the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, a long-promised goal of most Republicans, before turning to other key priorities such as an overhaul of the tax code or Trump’s infrastructure construction plan.

Trump and Ryan both said on Friday that they will next pursue a tax overhaul.
Caucus members insist they have not abandoned Trump. The group said on Twitter Friday that it “looks forward to working with him” on a future, “better’ health care bill.

“We will always be able to work with him,” Franks said Friday. “The president knows the Freedom Caucus are his strongest supporters.”
Saudi Embassy Confirms U.K. Attacker Had Been in Saudi Arabia.
The British man who killed four people during a London rampage had made three trips to Saudi Arabia: He taught English there twice on a work visa and returned on a visa usually granted to those going on a religious pilgrimage.

More details about attacker Khalid Masood's travels, confirmed by the Saudi Arabian embassy in Britain, emerged Saturday amid a massive British police effort to discover how a homegrown ex-con with a violent streak became radicalized and why he launched a deadly attack Wednesday on Westminster Bridge.

The embassy said he taught English in Saudi Arabia from November 2005 to November 2006 and again from April 2008 to April 2009, with legitimate work visas both times. He then returned to Saudi Arabia for six days in March 2015 on a trip booked through an approved travel agent and made on an "Umra" visa, usually granted to those on a religious pilgrimage to the country's Islamic holy sites.

The embassy said Saudi security services didn't track Masood and he didn't have a criminal record there.

Before taking the name Masood, he was called Adrian Elms. He was known for having a violent temper in England and had been convicted at least twice for violent crimes.

Masood drove his rented SUV across London's crowded Westminster Bridge on Wednesday, striking pedestrians. Then he jumped out and stabbed to death police officer Keith Palmer, who was guarding Parliament, before being shot dead by police.

In all, he killed four people and left more than two dozen hospitalized, including some with catastrophic injuries. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack, calling him a "solider" who responded to its demands that followers attack countries in the coalition fighting IS in Syria and Iraq.

British officials said security at Parliament will be reviewed after new footage emerged that showed the large gates to the complex were left open after Masood rushed onto the grounds. There are concerns that accomplices could have followed him in and killed even more people. The footage from that day shows pedestrians walking by the open gates and even a courier entering Parliament grounds.
Former Metropolitan Police commissioner Ian Blair told the BBC that changes to the "outer soft ring" of Parliament's security plan are likely in the aftermath of Masood's attack.

The new footage follows earlier video that showed slight delays and confusion during the evacuation of Prime Minister Theresa May from Parliament as the attack unfolded.

Masood, who at 52 is considerably older than most extremists who carry out bloodshed in the West, had an arrest record in Britain dating to 1983. In 2000, he slashed a man across the face in a pub parking lot in a racially charged argument after drinking, according to a newspaper account. Masood's last conviction, in 2003, also involved a knife attack.

One victim, Danny Smith, told The Sun newspaper that Masood had stabbed him in the face with a kitchen knife after an argument just three days after they met.

Hundreds of British police have been working to determine his motives and are scouring Masood's communications systems, including his possible use of the encrypted WhatsApp device, to help determine if he had any accomplices.

Still, police have released many of those they took in for questioning in the case.

One 58-year-old man remains in custody for questioning after being arrested Thursday in the central English city of Birmingham, where Masood was living. Authorities haven't charged or identified him.

A 32-year-old woman arrested in Manchester has been released on bail and faces further inquiries.

Police said Saturday that a 27-year-old man arrested Thursday in Birmingham has been released.

Eight others arrested in connection with the investigation had been set free earlier, including a 39-year-old woman who had initially been freed on bail but now faces no further police action, police said Saturday.

Details about how Masood became radicalized aren't clear, although he may have become exposed to radical views while an inmate in Britain or while working in conservative Saudi Arabia. It's also not clear when he took the name Masood, suggesting a conversion to Islam.
Barrick Gold Chairman's Total Compensation Boosted in 2016.
Thornton received a salary of $2.5 million, long-term incentives of $5.32 million, $307,198 in other compensation and a pension value of $375,000, the Toronto-based miner said Friday in a regulatory filing. “A significant majority” of the long-term compensation “must be used to purchase Barrick common shares, which must be held until the later of three years and the date he retires or leaves the company,” Barrick said in the filing.

Under Thornton, who is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. president, Barrick has emerged from a multiyear strategy to cut costs and sell assets to lower its debt. The miner’s shares more than doubled last year.

Thornton elected to forfeit $3.4 million of incentives for 2015, which means he received $3.1 million in total pay for the year. His total compensation in 2014 was $12.9 million, which included $9.5 million of incentive pay.

According to the filing, Barrick President Kelvin Dushnisky was awarded $5.21 million in compensation for 2016, including a salary of $905,760, share-based awards of $2.47 million and $1.41 million in incentive compensation. His total pay is up 20 percent from 2015.
Barrick Gold Corp. awarded Executive Chairman John Thornton $8.5 million in total compensation last year, more than double what he received in 2015 when he gave up his bonus in the wake of investor criticism of pay packages at the world’s largest gold producer.

Uber to Suspend Autonomous Tests After Arizona Accident.
Uber Technologies Inc. is suspending its self-driving car program after one of its autonomous vehicles was involved in a high-impact crash in Tempe, Arizona, the latest incident for a company reeling from multiple crises.

In a photo posted on Twitter, one of Uber’s Volvo self-driving SUVs is pictured on its side next to another car with dents and smashed windows. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed the incident, and the veracity of the photo, and added that the ride-hailing company is suspending its autonomous tests in Arizona until it completes its investigation and pausing its Pittsburgh operations.
The Uber vehicle was not responsible for the incident and there were no injuries, Tempe police information officer Josie Montenegro told Bloomberg News. Another car failed to yield for the Uber car, causing the autonomous vehicle to flip on its side, according to the police report.

"There was a person behind the wheel," said Montenegro regarding the Uber vehicle. "It is uncertain at this time if they were controlling the vehicle at the time of the collision."

An Uber spokeswoman said "we are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle."

Uber began testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh last year and soon expanded to Arizona, after its self-driving cars were banned from San Francisco’s streets in December by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The focus on self-driving cars was intended to demonstrate Uber’s progress with the nascent technology, and it began picking up customers in Tempe last month after Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a proponent of self-driving cars, took the inaugural ride.

However, Uber’s self-driving car program has been mired in controversy. Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s autonomous driving business that is also testing driverless vehicles in Arizona, sued an Uber unit called Otto earlier this year for allegedly stealing designs for an important component of driverless cars known as lidar. Uber called the suit "baseless."

The photo, showing the Uber SUV on its side, suggests a relatively high-impact crash. That would be a contrast to the incidents involving self-driving cars tested by Waymo. In more than 2 million miles of testing on public roads, Waymo’s vehicles were mostly minor incidents, often when other cars drove into the back of their vehicles in busy areas.

The incident also comes as Uber, and Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick, are currently under scrutiny because of a series of scandals. The ride-hailing company has been accused of operating a sexist workplace. This month, the New York Times reported that Uber used a tool called Greyball to help drivers evade government regulators and enforcement officials. Kalanick said he needed "leadership help" after Bloomberg published a video showing him arguing with an Uber driver.
As Uber Grew Hastily, Diversity Took a Backseat.
Under pressure from harassment and sexism allegations, the ride-hailing giant is rethinking its approach to hiring.
Efforts to hire more women and people of color at Uber Technologies Inc. have been long hindered by a peculiar constraint. Members of the recruiting team were denied access to information about the company’s diversity makeup, according to several people familiar with Uber’s hiring apparatus.

The recruiting arm assigns some members to focus on hiring diverse candidates, an initiative that has received enthusiastic endorsements from Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick. But the team found it difficult to do its job without demographic data, which is a common way to identify a company’s weaknesses and set hiring targets, the people said. Like many of its Silicon Valley cohorts, Uber is an obsessively data-driven company, where recruiters log every interaction with candidates and scour their social media profiles. The diversity data limitation was especially vexing because other technology companies of its size release annual diversity reports to the public.

Uber’s demographic composition has been a topic of interest for people outside the recruiting department, too. Various female software engineers have requested such data for years and were told the human resources department didn’t track it. Some of them began calculating it on their own in an attempt to determine which managers seemed friendliest to women, said a former employee.

Beyond the lack of data, the company’s recruitment efforts struggled from a dearth of focus, funding and leadership. At least a half-dozen Uber recruiters involved in diversity initiatives have left in the past 18 months. Several of those people said diversity took a backseat to the company’s needs to hire quickly.

Liane Hornsey, Uber’s senior vice president of HR, said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday that she’s working to clean up Uber’s cultural problems, including its approach to recruiting. Hornsey, who joined the company this year, said Uber revised 1,500 job descriptions to remove unconscious bias from the language, will hold job interview training for women in tech and is ensuring its panel of interviewers is diverse. Uber plans to release a diversity report for the first time next week. “We’re spending a good deal of time reflecting on what will lead to true diversity and inclusion,” Hornsey wrote in an email. “Clearly, this matters a lot to all of us and must underpin everything we do—it’s the foundation of positive cultural change.”

Bloomberg spoke with about a dozen current and former Uber staffers familiar with the company’s hiring process, including several members of the recruiting team. They asked not to be identified because many have employment contracts that bar them from criticizing the company. Their experiences illustrate how a startup defined on breaking rules and expanding at any cost can develop into a homogenous work environment, where discrimination goes unchecked. Uber, valued at $69 billion, has become the latest test case for Silicon Valley’s enduring inclusion issues.
Uber is under enormous scrutiny following recent accusations of a toxic and sexist workplace. Susan Fowler, a former software engineer at the company, wrote a blog post last month alleging that her boss at Uber propositioned her for sex and was protected by HR. She also said women were discriminated against throughout the technical group.

The ride-hailing giant is now trying to rehabilitate its image and ease employee unrest. It hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the sexual harassment claims and the company’s culture. The results of this probe are expected by the end of April and will be released to the public, according to Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member.

The company all-hands meeting each Tuesday has become a weekly airing of grievances, where Kalanick has offered several tearful apologies. The 40-year-old CEO delivered one such atonement publicly after Bloomberg published a video showing him arguing with an Uber driver. Kalanick said he needed “leadership help” and would hire an operating chief. Some insiders are pushing for a strong female leader to take the role.

As the company prepares a full diversity report, it has presented one stat: 15 percent of engineers, scientists and product managers are women. This is lower than other startups, and even its bigger and older tech peers, including Facebook Inc., which has struggled with its own diversity hiring initiatives. Airbnb Inc., which was founded around the same time as Uber, said 26 percent of technical employees are women. Lyft Inc., which is Uber’s main competitor in the U.S., said it plans to release its first diversity report in the coming weeks.
Companies that have successfully improved diversity numbers typically take a systematic approach to diversity hiring processes and goals, make their inclusion commitments clear and reach out to and recruit from diverse professional organizations, said Andrea Hoffman, founder of the diversity consulting firm Culture Shift Labs. Those initiatives must be driven by corporate chiefs, she said. “This is a multifaceted approach that starts at the top.”

In the occasional meeting between Kalanick and some members of Uber’s recruiting team, the CEO would strike an upbeat tone toward diversity. But when staff would propose investing more in that area, recruiters became frustrated after he repeatedly postponed decisions, said a person familiar with the gatherings. “Let’s keep jamming on this,” Kalanick would say, deploying a common Uber-ism.

Kalanick would also refer to the company’s 14 cultural values, which include “meritocracy and toe-stepping,” meaning good ideas are valued above all else. Employees were evaluated in performance reviews on how well they exhibited these values. None of the 14 values refer specifically to diversity or inclusion. Kalanick often said diversity comes in many different forms and resisted the idea of prioritizing race or gender, according to two people. He’s said Uber should look for the “best minds.”

“The culture that Uber’s wanted to build is not one that’s designed to be inclusive and equitable”


In 2015, as Uber was expanding worldwide and more than doubling headcount, it hired Damien Hooper-Campbell as global diversity and inclusion lead. Hooper-Campbell, who is black, has extensive experience in the area. He was an assistant director of minority initiatives at Harvard Business School, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice president focused on inclusion efforts and a diversity strategist at Google. Renee Atwood, Uber’s former HR head, held his appointment up as proof that the company was working to create a more diverse culture in a 2015 Wired story.

Hooper-Campbell was initially tasked with planning diversity recruitment programs and outlining goals to make Uber more hospitable to minorities working there, said two former employees. The move was encouraging to his fellow recruiters, who were frustrated by a lack of leadership on diversity projects at the company’s San Francisco headquarters.

But Hooper-Campbell’s job soon changed. He was dispatched to Oakland to serve as a face of the company to local officials and help oversee logistics around the new office, the people said. “His role was in constant flux,” Sean Cervera, a former colleague on Uber’s recruiting team, recalled in a blog post this month. Within a year, Hooper-Campbell left to become chief diversity officer at EBay Inc. A spokeswoman for EBay declined to make him available for an interview.

Cervera wrote that he had been enlisted to help Uber find more diverse recruits in technical roles but was only allowed to spend 10 percent of his time on inclusion initiatives. Cervera, who now works on inclusion recruiting programs at Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn, declined to comment.

At times, Uber’s recruiting leadership seemed to be preoccupied with gimmicks. Last year, Jim Baaden, the global head of recruiting, hosted several events for job candidates in which attendees were asked to break into small groups and put on blindfolds, said five people familiar with the proceedings. Candidates were instructed to pluck sateen blindfolds from a cardboard box and silently arrange puzzle pieces into molded shapes. The Uber staff hosting the event set a timer to seven minutes, while they clapped vigorously and blasted pop music from a stereo. Afterward, an Uber recruiting coordinator explained that the purpose of the exercise was to see how applicants approach problems in a chaotic situation. The exercise, which is called Colourblind, is also used by other companies as a test of teamwork.

Uber missed an important opportunity last year by not placing a higher priority on diversity, said Joelle Emerson, who runs diversity consulting firm Paradigm. Uber’s staff more than doubled again in 2016, exceeding 12,000 employees today. “The culture that Uber’s wanted to build is not one that’s designed to be inclusive and equitable and set everyone up for success. And I think that is the underlying problem,” Emerson said. “Having a more diverse organization can help drive a more positive culture.”

After repeated vacillations by Kalanick, Uber eventually committed cash to diversity programs. In October, Baaden distributed $25,000 apiece to several identity-based employee resource groups at Uber, catering to LGBT, female engineers and others, a person familiar with the matter said. A few months later, the company hired Bernard Coleman, the former chief diversity officer for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, as head of diversity and inclusion.

Baaden pointed to the addition of Coleman in a recent interview as evidence that the company cares about diversity. “You bring in someone like that, the expectation is that it continues to be an important consideration for us as we invest and think about programs and think about different ways to engage a diverse population of both employees and talent,” Baaden said.

But Mitch and Freada Kapor, a pair of early Uber investors, believe the company isn’t doing enough. Uber has had “countless opportunities to do the right thing,” they wrote in a blog post. “Uber’s outsize success in terms of growth of market share, revenues and valuation are impressive, but can never excuse a culture plagued by disrespect, exclusionary cliques, lack of diversity, and tolerance for bullying and harassment of every form.”

A week after their rebuke, Kalanick asked for the resignation of a newly appointed senior executive, who was investigated by his former employer over a sexual harassment claim. Uber recruiters weren’t aware of the issue before he was hired. The executive, Amit Singhal, denied the allegation. Hornsey, the new HR head, said on Tuesday that the company has been talking with the Kapors and will take their input into account. On Thursday, Kalanick met with the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

The scandals are beginning to take a toll on Uber’s ability to recruit talent. Cassie Vance, a brand strategy expert in San Francisco, said she was approached by the ride-hailing giant this month about a job opportunity. “Under normal circumstances, I’d love to have a conversation regarding a role like this, because it sounds right up my alley. But you and I both know these are not normal circumstances,” Vance wrote to the recruiter, according to a copy of the LinkedIn message seen by Bloomberg. “To say that I’d be embarrassed to have Uber on my résumé would be a gross understatement. I know I’m not the only person that feels this way, and if you ask me, there’s no marketing strategy that is going to get you guys out of the hole you’ve dug yourselves.”

Uber Rival Grab Raising $1.5 Billion in New Funding Round.
Grab, Uber Technologies Inc.’s largest rival in Southeast Asia, plans to raise more than $1.5 billion in a new funding round backed by SoftBank Group Corp., people familiar with the matter said.

SoftBank is pledging about $1 billion in the ride-sharing company backed by Tiger Global Management and GGV Capital, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. It wasn’t clear if the money was coming from the Japanese company itself or its yet-to-close SoftBank Vision Fund. Grab’s financing could be a record for Southeast Asia, eclipsing the $750 million the company raised in September in a round said to give it a then valuation of more than $3 billion.

Grab, which this week announced plans to expand to its seventh country in the region, is racing against Uber and Go-Jek Indonesia PT to cast its net across more cities and drum up business for its nascent payments platform. The companies have been engaged in a cash-burning battle underpinned by their ability to raise funds and expand in one of the fastest growing markets globally.

Grab declined to comment. SoftBank wasn’t immediately able to comment.

SoftBank’s billionaire Chairman Masayoshi Son is trying to close his $100 billion Vision Fund, which is being backed by his own company, along with money from Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development Co. Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison may invest $1 billion each, people familiar with the matter have said.

As SoftBank closes in on the first round of the fund, it has cut investment deals, including for satellite startup OneWeb Ltd., that it said will likely be included in the fund.

Grab has pledged $700 million in investment in Indonesia in the next four years, seeking to win over a market with 260 million people. Indonesia is Grab’s largest market, where the four-year-old company saw more than 600 percent growth last year.

It’s hiring more than 800 new research and development staff in six centers over the next two years, including new facilities in Bangalore and Ho Chi Minh City. The company has said it is willing to set aside much as $100 million to bankroll early-stage startups in mobile and financial services technology in Indonesia.

Grab’s September fundraising was also led by SoftBank.
Trump tastes failure as U.S. House healthcare bill collapses.
President Donald Trump suffered a stunning political setback on Friday in a Congress controlled by his own party when Republican leaders pulled legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies.
President Donald Trump suffered a stunning political setback on Friday in a Congress controlled by his own party when Republican leaders pulled legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies.

House of Representatives leaders yanked the bill after a rebellion by Republican moderates and the party's most conservative lawmakers left them short of votes, ensuring that Trump's first major legislative initiative since taking office on Jan. 20 ended in failure. Democrats were unified against it.

House Republicans had planned a vote on the measure after Trump late on Thursday cut off negotiations with Republicans who had balked at the plan and issued an ultimatum to vote on Friday, win or lose. But desperate lobbying by the White House and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was unable to round up the 216 votes needed for passage.

"We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process," Trump told reporters at the White House, although he sought to shift the blame to the Democrats even though his party controls the White House, the House and the Senate.

With Friday's legislative collapse, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - remains in place despite seven years of Republican promises to dismantle it.

The healthcare failure called into question not only Trump's ability to get other key parts of his agenda, including tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending, through Congress, but the Republican Party's capacity to govern effectively.

Neither Trump nor Ryan indicated any plans to try to tackle healthcare legislation again anytime soon. Trump said he would turn his attention to getting "big tax cuts" through Congress, another tricky proposition.

Republican supporters said the legislation would achieve their goal of rolling back the government's "nanny state" role in healthcare. The White House made undoing Obamacare its top priority when Trump took office two months ago.

But the White House and House leaders were unable to come up with a plan that satisfied the clashing interests of moderates and conservatives, despite Trump's vaunted image as a deal maker.

Amid a chaotic scramble for votes, Ryan, who championed the bill, met with Trump at the White House. Ryan said he recommended that it be withdrawn from the House floor because he did not have the votes to pass it, and Trump agreed.

"We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short," Trump said. "With no Democrat support we couldn't quite get there."

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the bill failed "because of two traits that have plagued the Trump presidency since he took office: incompetence and broken promises."

Democrats said the bill would take away medical insurance from millions of Americans and leave the more-than-$3 trillion U.S. healthcare system in disarray.

And some moderate Republicans opposed the bill because of worries that millions of America would be hurt.

"There were things in this bill that I didn't particularly like," Trump added, without specifying what those were, but expressed confidence in Ryan's leadership.

"Perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes," said Trump, who had posted multiple tweets throughout March proclaiming that "Obamacare is imploding" and repeatedly saying that Republicans were coming together to pass the bill.

Friday's events cast doubt on whether Ryan can get major legislation approved by fractious Republican lawmakers.

"I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard," Ryan said at a news conference, adding that his fellow Republicans are experiencing what he called "growing pains" transitioning from an opposition party to a governing party.

"Obamacare's the law of the land," Ryan added. "We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future."

"A LITTLE SURPRISED"

Members of the Freedom Caucus, the House's most conservative members, were instrumental in the bill's failure, opposing it among other reasons because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare.

Trump said he was disappointed and "a little surprised" with the Freedom Caucus opposition.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said under the Republican legislation 14 million people would lose medical coverage by next year and more than 24 million would be uninsured in 2026.

News that the bill had been pulled before a final vote was greeted initially with a small sigh of relief by U.S. equity investors, who earlier in the week had been fretful that an outright defeat would damage Trump's other priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending.

Benchmark U.S. stock market indexes ended the session mixed after rallying back from session lows following the news. The S&P 500 Index ended fractionally lower, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped about 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose about 0.2 percent.

Shares of hospital operators finished sharply higher, with the S&P healthcare facilities index up 2.7 percent, while the S&P 500 healthcare sector edged down 0.03 percent. The dollar strengthened modestly on the news, and U.S. Treasury bond yields edged up from session lows.

Trump said he would be "totally open" to working with Democrats on healthcare "when they all become civilized." House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said working to lower prescription drug prices was one area of possible cooperation with Republicans.

Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher said before the bill was pulled that voting it down would be "neutering Trump" while empowering his opponents.

"You don't cut the balls off a bull and then expect that he can go out and get the job done," Rohrabacher told Reuters. "This will emasculate Trump and we can't do that. ... If we bring this down now, Trump will have lost all of his leverage to pass whatever bill it is, whether it's the tax bill or whatever reforms that he wants."

Representative Joe Barton of Texas, when asked why his fellow Republicans were so united over the past seven years to dump Obamacare only to fall apart when they actually do something about it, said, "Sometimes you're playing fantasy football and sometimes you’re in the real game."

Obamacare boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law.

The House plan would have rescinded a range of taxes created by Obamacare, ended a penalty on people who refuse to obtain health insurance, and ended Obamacare's income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax credits

It also would have ended Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid state-federal insurance program for the poor, cut future federal Medicaid funding and let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients.

House leaders agreed to a series of last-minute changes to try to win over disgruntled conservatives, including ending the Obamacare requirement that insurers cover certain "essential benefits" such as maternity care, mental health services and prescription drug coverage.
With healthcare bill dead, Republicans turn to taxes.
After failing to repeal Obamacare, Republicans in the U.S. Congress quickly pivoted on Friday to President Donald Trump's next priority: overhauling the federal tax code, but their plan has already split the business community.

Division among Republicans was the chief cause of the embarrassing setback on Obamacare, and similar fault lines have been evident for months in the Republicans' tax plan, mainly over an untested proposal to use the tax code to boost exports.

House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady conceded the demise of a Republican plan to roll back Obamacare could make the path to tax reform harder. "This made a big challenge more challenging. But it’s not insurmountable," he told Fox News after Ryan canceled a vote on an Obamacare rollback bill.

But Brady said he and House Speaker Paul Ryan are all-in on tax reform.

Brady said House Republicans plan to begin moving on tax reform this spring and to pass legislation before Congress's summer recess in late July.

"We’re going to work with the administration to get this done,” he said.

Trump has been unclear about his position on the most problematic feature of the House Republicans' tax "blueprint," a proposal known as the border adjustment tax that would cut taxes on exports and raise them on imports.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that tax reform in many ways is "a lot simpler" than healthcare reform.

"We're able to take the tax code and redesign things and I think there is very, very strong support," Mnuchin said at an event hosted by news website Axios.

Comprehensive tax reform is a policy goal so complex that it has defied successive Congresses and presidents since 1986 when it was last accomplished under former President Ronald Reagan.

The U.S. tax code is riddled with narrow subsidies and loopholes, many of them deeply embedded in the economy and defended by the interests they benefit, such as the mortgage interest deduction and the business interest deductibility.

Brady's panel has been working on a plan since mid-2016 that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, end taxing foreign profits for U.S.-based multinationals and cut other tax rates for businesses and investors.

The plan has divided businesses, prompting import-dependent industries to warn of higher prices for consumer goods from clothing and electronics to gasoline.

Brady has been adamant that border adjustment will be part of the House tax reform, saying earlier this week that the provision was "a given" for final legislation but would include a transition period for import-heavy industries.

Trump tastes failure as U.S. House healthcare bill collapses
For Trump, it was the lost art of the deal

Trump disappointed House conservatives blocked healthcare bill.
President Donald Trump said on Friday that he was disappointed that a conservative faction in the House of Representatives blocked his healthcare legislation and said "we learned a lot about loyalty" from the effort.

Speaking in the Oval Office after a stunning political setback, Trump said the healthcare effort was a victim of stalwart Democratic opposition and any future healthcare legislation would likely need Democratic support.

He also said he was surprised and disappointed by the opposition from the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservatives who prevented Republicans from using their majority in the House to pass the legislation.

Asked if he felt betrayed by the Freedom Caucus, Trump said he did not.

No, I'm not betrayed. They're friends of mine. I'm disappointed because we could have had it. So I'm disappointed. I'm a little surprised, to be honest with you," Trump said.

"We really had it. It was pretty much there, within grasp. But I'll tell you what's going to come of it is a better bill...because there were things in this bill that I didn't particularly like. If both parties could get together and do real healthcare, that's the best thing," he said.

Trump, a New York businessman who won election Nov. 8 based in part on promises to get big deals through Congress, cast the failure as a learning experience.

“We all learned a lot. We learned a lot about loyalty," Trump said. "We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the Senate and the House."

Trump also expressed confidence in House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was seen as the main backer of the legislation. Ryan personally delivered the news earlier in the day to Trump that there were not enough votes to pass it.

"I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very, very hard. A lot of different groups. He's got a lot of factions. And there's been a long history of liking and disliking, even within the Republican Party, long before I got here," he said. "I'm not going to speak badly about anybody within the party."

Trump has privately told confidants he wished he had done tax reform first instead of getting immersed in the difficult effort to overhaul President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which passed without Republican support in 2010.

"We'll probably be going right now for tax reform," Trump said, saying he wanted "big tax cuts and tax reform. That will be next."
Speaker Ryan dented by healthcare debacle, but keeps support.
U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday acknowledged the unthinkable for a Republican leader: he could not deliver the votes to repeal and replace Obamacare, even though he and his fellow Republicans had vowed to do so for seven years.

Nevertheless, Ryan's job did not seem to be under immediate threat, at least not in the House of Representatives he leads.

Ryan's long-time news media nemesis, the website Breitbart, said Republicans were "openly discussing" finding a replacement for him after he pulled a bill to roll back Obamacare from the House floor just minutes before an intensely awaited final vote. The Breitbart article did not quote anyone by name.

In the House, just after the bill was pulled, several lawmakers brushed aside suggestions that the failure spelled trouble for Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate, who many have speculated has presidential ambitions.

Ryan, 47, has been speaker since October 2015. Under the law, he is next in line to the presidency after Vice President Mike Pence.

Republican Representative Justin Amash, a harsh critic of the ill-fated healthcare bill, told reporters, "We can do better with the legislative process." But, he added, "Nobody is talking about" trying to oust Ryan as speaker.

Amash had disparagingly dubbed the Republican healthcare bill "Obamacare 2.0," after Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.

Amash is a member of the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, which in 2015 ousted Ryan's predecessor as speaker, John Boehner, from the post. The caucus played a key role in the demise of the healthcare bill.

Ryan chose to make healthcare reform the first target on a list of legislative goals for the new Republican-majority Congress. He admitted on Friday that he was disappointed by the outcome.

Republicans faced resistance to the healthcare bill from both conservatives and moderates, making the process of winning passage difficult for the leadership.

Republican Representative Joe Barton, asked about the impact of Friday's loss on Ryan, told reporters: "The speaker is a human being. He's not Superman."

Republican Representative Barry Loudermilk, who backed the healthcare bill, said he didn't think the loss weakened the speaker's hand.

One Republican lawmaker who has been considered potential speaker material, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, effusively praised Ryan, saying he had shown "phenomenal leadership."

"It is my hope that we can regroup and rally behind him (Ryan) and the president as a conference to deliver on our promise" to dismantle Obamacare, Hensarling said in a statement.
Iran denies harassing U.S. warships in Gulf, warns of clashes.
Iran denied on Saturday U.S. accusations that its fast-attack boats were "harassing" warships at the mouth of the Gulf, and said Washington would be responsible for any clashes in the key oil shipping route.

U.S. Navy commanders earlier accused Iran of jeopardizing international navigation by "harassing" warships passing through the Strait of Hormuz and said future incidents could result in miscalculation and lead to an armed clash.

They spoke after the U.S. aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush confronted what one of the commanding officers described as two sets of Iranian Navy fast-attack boats that had approached a U.S.-led, five-vessel flotilla as it entered the Strait on Tuesday on a journey from the Indian Ocean into the Gulf.

It was the first time a U.S. carrier entered the narrow waterway, where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass, since President Donald Trump took office in January pledging a tougher U.S. stance towards Iran.

In Tehran, Brigadier General Masoud Jazayeri, deputy chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, said the U.S. claims of the confrontation in the Gulf were based on "false reports or ulterior motives", the state news agency IRNA reported.

"We emphasize that the Americans would be responsible for any unrest in the Persian Gulf, and again warn that the U.S. military must change its behavior," Jazayeri said, without elaborating.

U.S. commanders earlier said Tuesday's incident, in which the George H.W. Bush sent helicopter gunships to hover over the Iranian speedboats as some came as close as 950 yards (870 meters) from the aircraft carrier, ended without a shot being fired.

But it underscored growing tension between the United States and Iran since the election of Trump, who has condemned the 2015 nuclear deal that his predecessor Barack Obama and leaders of five other world powers struck with Tehran and labeled the Islamic Republic "the number one terrorist state".

The encounter with Iranian Navy boats occurred as the USS George H.W. Bush was en route to the northern part of the Gulf to participate in U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

Earlier in March, Iran disputed the U.S. account of another confrontation in the Strait of Hormuz between its speedboats and a U.S. Navy vessel.
Trump Meets Freedom Caucus and Result Is Legislative Disaster.
During one of his frequent visits to the White House in recent days, Representative Mark Meadows listened to Donald Trump talk about a tote-board he uses to track his presidential campaign promises.

It included the one Meadows was there to talk about, repealing Obamacare. Trump made clear to the head of the House Freedom Caucus that he’s been going down that board, checking off each promise on the list -- and that he wanted to cross this one off too, so he could move on to a tax overhaul and others.

Except it wasn’t that simple. House leaders abruptly scrapped a planned vote on repeal Friday because not enough support materialized, largely due to Meadows’s Freedom Caucus, made up of Congress’s most rebellious conservative members.

For Trump, it was a taste of the anti-establishment fury that propelled him to the White House, delivered by a band of Republican lawmakers who’d rather defy the president than compromise on their conservative ideals.

Put simply, Trump underestimated them, failing to appreciate their determination to block legislation they considered a politically dubious half-measure, even if doing so humiliated Trump, lawmakers and conservative activists said.

“Members of the Freedom Caucus are committed to their constituents and their conservative values. If President Trump was not aware of their resolve before, he is now,” said Alice Stewart, who was a strategist on Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign.

Turning to Taxes

There’s no evidence the group is prepared to fall in line any more easily behind Trump’s next legislation target, the first comprehensive tax overhaul in 30 years. The group’s roughly 40 members are strong believers in low taxes and small government, and also want to rein in entitlements and slash the deficit, two things Trump has never made a priority.

"For the good of our country, I want to see President Trump and his agenda succeed," said Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, a leading group member who complained the leaders’ bill left too much of Obamacare in place. But in the same statement, Brat said, "My promise to my constituents remains the same: I will always follow my principles, work toward good policy, and listen to my constituents."


What’s surprising to some analysts is that anyone can still be surprised. Conservatives who were later to form into the Freedom Caucus pushed for the government shutdown in 2013 over the objections of House leaders. It’s the group that ran off former Speaker John Boehner after finding him too willing to compromise with Democrats. And now it’s the catalyst behind the deal of Trump’s hoped-for health overhaul.

“They’re friends of mine,” Trump said of the caucus on Friday, after House Speaker Paul Ryan had pulled the bill from the floor. “I’m disappointed because we could have had it. I’m a little surprised, to be honest with you.”

Trump displayed some frustration with the group Friday morning, before the bill collapsed, in a tweet from his personal account.

“The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!” he said. Now that frustration has bled over to some in the House Republican conference, who say the group abandoned Trump at a critical moment and is too lashed to its rigid ideology.

‘Freedom Caucus rate hike’

Representative Chris Collins of New York, a close Trump ally, has said the group should disband and fold itself back into a larger conservative caucus, the Republican Study Committee. Representative Austin Scott of Georgia suggested that if health insurance premiums rise as a result of the House bill’s failure, the Freedom Caucus would be to blame.

“Get ready for the Freedom Caucus rate hike,” he said.

Trump might be forgiven for thinking the group would be a surefire "yes." Nearly all came from congressional districts Trump carried overwhelmingly. Many backed his campaign.

Indeed, roughly half of the Freedom Caucus members were ready to sign on to the Obamacare repeal bill. The other half still thought it didn’t go nearly far enough. Meadows and other members picked up on Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul’s saddling of the bill with a label that probably helped doom it: "Obamacare Lite."

For the bill’s supporters, it was a promising enough start. Representative Dave Schweikert of Arizona said he was proud to have voted to advance the measure out of the Ways and Means Committee, and praised it as a move to dismantle Obamacare’s "damaging taxes and mandates" so states could deliver better, more affordable health options.

Schweikert’s Arizona colleague, Representative Trent Franks, also came to support the measure, although he wasn’t happy about the limitations placed on the bill to conform with Senate rules.

But Brat, who said the bill didn’t go far enough to undo Obamacare’s regulations on insurance companies, was among others who weren’t ready to support it. He said Saturday, "The initial construction of this bill kept the structure and architecture of Obamacare fully in place."

Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan of Ohio stuck to his insistence that Congress needed to first pass a complete, clean repeal of Obamacare, and then get to work on devising a replacement. After the bill was pulled, he said, "Now, House Republicans owe it to our constituents to immediately get back to the drawing board and bring forward a bolder effort to replace the failing Obamacare with a plan to reduce costs by increasing choice and competition."

White House Meetings

It wasn’t that Trump didn’t try to get support from the Freedom Caucus. He invited the group to the White House several times -- and more importantly, asked its members to offer suggestions to improve the bill. (Trump made the same offer to the moderate "Tuesday Group" of House Republicans, at a time when Ryan was trying to rally support behind the existing bill.)

The negotiating intensified between the White House and the group in the last week, and the Freedom Caucus members said the talks were productive, but complained about Ryan’s Thursday time line for a vote as arbitrary and rushed.

After Trump visited Capitol Hill Tuesday, he brought some members of the group to the White House Wednesday, prompting Meadows to return to the Capitol and tell reporters he was "cautiously optimistic."   Even as he went into a meeting with fellow caucus members to describe the developments, he says Trump personally called him on his cellphone to talk some more.

Meadows had won a big concession from the president -- the bill would be changed to strip out Obamacare’s requirements that health insurers provide a set of essential health benefits. But the last-minute change wasn’t quite enough for the Freedom Caucus holdouts, but went too far for some wavering moderates, who declared their opposition the next day.

After another meeting Thursday with some members of the caucus and the president, there was still no deal, and Ryan’s plan to vote that day, on the seventh anniversary of Obamacare being signed into law, was put off. A last-ditch meeting Friday with Vice President Mike Pence, who served 12 years in the House, also failed to break the logjam. And the bill was pulled, 30 minutes before the scheduled vote.

Conservative groups place some of the blame on Ryan, who has generally had good relations with the group after working early on to give them more say in Republican matters than Boehner did and more freedom to bring bills to the floor.

But in this case, the Freedom Caucus was only looped in after the bill was introduced and an avalanche of criticism already had mounted on the right, making it more difficult for the group to get on board.

Wide Opposition

The bill achieved the rare feat of uniting Democrats and Republicans on both ideological ends of their party in opposition. Moderate Republicans worried that the legislation would leave too many Americans without coverage and drive up insurance premiums.

The Congressional Budget Office said that about 24 million Americans would lose or drop their insurance coverage over a decade, at a savings of about $150 billion to the federal government.

Miscalculating the depth of the Freedom Caucus’s opposition leaves Trump’s ambitious agenda in jeopardy. Congressional leaders had maintained that they must tackle the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, a long-promised goal of most Republicans, before turning to other key priorities such as an overhaul of the tax code or Trump’s infrastructure construction plan.

Trump and Ryan both said on Friday that they will next pursue a tax overhaul.
Caucus members insist they have not abandoned Trump. The group said on Twitter Friday that it “looks forward to working with him” on a future, “better’ health care bill.

“We will always be able to work with him,” Franks said Friday. “The president knows the Freedom Caucus are his strongest supporters.”
Saudi Embassy Confirms U.K. Attacker Had Been in Saudi Arabia.
The British man who killed four people during a London rampage had made three trips to Saudi Arabia: He taught English there twice on a work visa and returned on a visa usually granted to those going on a religious pilgrimage.

More details about attacker Khalid Masood's travels, confirmed by the Saudi Arabian embassy in Britain, emerged Saturday amid a massive British police effort to discover how a homegrown ex-con with a violent streak became radicalized and why he launched a deadly attack Wednesday on Westminster Bridge.

The embassy said he taught English in Saudi Arabia from November 2005 to November 2006 and again from April 2008 to April 2009, with legitimate work visas both times. He then returned to Saudi Arabia for six days in March 2015 on a trip booked through an approved travel agent and made on an "Umra" visa, usually granted to those on a religious pilgrimage to the country's Islamic holy sites.

The embassy said Saudi security services didn't track Masood and he didn't have a criminal record there.

Before taking the name Masood, he was called Adrian Elms. He was known for having a violent temper in England and had been convicted at least twice for violent crimes.

Masood drove his rented SUV across London's crowded Westminster Bridge on Wednesday, striking pedestrians. Then he jumped out and stabbed to death police officer Keith Palmer, who was guarding Parliament, before being shot dead by police.

In all, he killed four people and left more than two dozen hospitalized, including some with catastrophic injuries. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack, calling him a "solider" who responded to its demands that followers attack countries in the coalition fighting IS in Syria and Iraq.

British officials said security at Parliament will be reviewed after new footage emerged that showed the large gates to the complex were left open after Masood rushed onto the grounds. There are concerns that accomplices could have followed him in and killed even more people. The footage from that day shows pedestrians walking by the open gates and even a courier entering Parliament grounds.
Former Metropolitan Police commissioner Ian Blair told the BBC that changes to the "outer soft ring" of Parliament's security plan are likely in the aftermath of Masood's attack.

The new footage follows earlier video that showed slight delays and confusion during the evacuation of Prime Minister Theresa May from Parliament as the attack unfolded.

Masood, who at 52 is considerably older than most extremists who carry out bloodshed in the West, had an arrest record in Britain dating to 1983. In 2000, he slashed a man across the face in a pub parking lot in a racially charged argument after drinking, according to a newspaper account. Masood's last conviction, in 2003, also involved a knife attack.

One victim, Danny Smith, told The Sun newspaper that Masood had stabbed him in the face with a kitchen knife after an argument just three days after they met.

Hundreds of British police have been working to determine his motives and are scouring Masood's communications systems, including his possible use of the encrypted WhatsApp device, to help determine if he had any accomplices.

Still, police have released many of those they took in for questioning in the case.

One 58-year-old man remains in custody for questioning after being arrested Thursday in the central English city of Birmingham, where Masood was living. Authorities haven't charged or identified him.

A 32-year-old woman arrested in Manchester has been released on bail and faces further inquiries.

Police said Saturday that a 27-year-old man arrested Thursday in Birmingham has been released.

Eight others arrested in connection with the investigation had been set free earlier, including a 39-year-old woman who had initially been freed on bail but now faces no further police action, police said Saturday.

Details about how Masood became radicalized aren't clear, although he may have become exposed to radical views while an inmate in Britain or while working in conservative Saudi Arabia. It's also not clear when he took the name Masood, suggesting a conversion to Islam.
Barrick Gold Chairman's Total Compensation Boosted in 2016.
Thornton received a salary of $2.5 million, long-term incentives of $5.32 million, $307,198 in other compensation and a pension value of $375,000, the Toronto-based miner said Friday in a regulatory filing. “A significant majority” of the long-term compensation “must be used to purchase Barrick common shares, which must be held until the later of three years and the date he retires or leaves the company,” Barrick said in the filing.

Under Thornton, who is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. president, Barrick has emerged from a multiyear strategy to cut costs and sell assets to lower its debt. The miner’s shares more than doubled last year.

Thornton elected to forfeit $3.4 million of incentives for 2015, which means he received $3.1 million in total pay for the year. His total compensation in 2014 was $12.9 million, which included $9.5 million of incentive pay.

According to the filing, Barrick President Kelvin Dushnisky was awarded $5.21 million in compensation for 2016, including a salary of $905,760, share-based awards of $2.47 million and $1.41 million in incentive compensation. His total pay is up 20 percent from 2015.
Barrick Gold Corp. awarded Executive Chairman John Thornton $8.5 million in total compensation last year, more than double what he received in 2015 when he gave up his bonus in the wake of investor criticism of pay packages at the world’s largest gold producer.

Uber to Suspend Autonomous Tests After Arizona Accident.
Uber Technologies Inc. is suspending its self-driving car program after one of its autonomous vehicles was involved in a high-impact crash in Tempe, Arizona, the latest incident for a company reeling from multiple crises.

In a photo posted on Twitter, one of Uber’s Volvo self-driving SUVs is pictured on its side next to another car with dents and smashed windows. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed the incident, and the veracity of the photo, and added that the ride-hailing company is suspending its autonomous tests in Arizona until it completes its investigation and pausing its Pittsburgh operations.
The Uber vehicle was not responsible for the incident and there were no injuries, Tempe police information officer Josie Montenegro told Bloomberg News. Another car failed to yield for the Uber car, causing the autonomous vehicle to flip on its side, according to the police report.

"There was a person behind the wheel," said Montenegro regarding the Uber vehicle. "It is uncertain at this time if they were controlling the vehicle at the time of the collision."

An Uber spokeswoman said "we are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle."

Uber began testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh last year and soon expanded to Arizona, after its self-driving cars were banned from San Francisco’s streets in December by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The focus on self-driving cars was intended to demonstrate Uber’s progress with the nascent technology, and it began picking up customers in Tempe last month after Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a proponent of self-driving cars, took the inaugural ride.

However, Uber’s self-driving car program has been mired in controversy. Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s autonomous driving business that is also testing driverless vehicles in Arizona, sued an Uber unit called Otto earlier this year for allegedly stealing designs for an important component of driverless cars known as lidar. Uber called the suit "baseless."

The photo, showing the Uber SUV on its side, suggests a relatively high-impact crash. That would be a contrast to the incidents involving self-driving cars tested by Waymo. In more than 2 million miles of testing on public roads, Waymo’s vehicles were mostly minor incidents, often when other cars drove into the back of their vehicles in busy areas.

The incident also comes as Uber, and Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick, are currently under scrutiny because of a series of scandals. The ride-hailing company has been accused of operating a sexist workplace. This month, the New York Times reported that Uber used a tool called Greyball to help drivers evade government regulators and enforcement officials. Kalanick said he needed "leadership help" after Bloomberg published a video showing him arguing with an Uber driver.
As Uber Grew Hastily, Diversity Took a Backseat.
Under pressure from harassment and sexism allegations, the ride-hailing giant is rethinking its approach to hiring.
Efforts to hire more women and people of color at Uber Technologies Inc. have been long hindered by a peculiar constraint. Members of the recruiting team were denied access to information about the company’s diversity makeup, according to several people familiar with Uber’s hiring apparatus.

The recruiting arm assigns some members to focus on hiring diverse candidates, an initiative that has received enthusiastic endorsements from Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick. But the team found it difficult to do its job without demographic data, which is a common way to identify a company’s weaknesses and set hiring targets, the people said. Like many of its Silicon Valley cohorts, Uber is an obsessively data-driven company, where recruiters log every interaction with candidates and scour their social media profiles. The diversity data limitation was especially vexing because other technology companies of its size release annual diversity reports to the public.

Uber’s demographic composition has been a topic of interest for people outside the recruiting department, too. Various female software engineers have requested such data for years and were told the human resources department didn’t track it. Some of them began calculating it on their own in an attempt to determine which managers seemed friendliest to women, said a former employee.

Beyond the lack of data, the company’s recruitment efforts struggled from a dearth of focus, funding and leadership. At least a half-dozen Uber recruiters involved in diversity initiatives have left in the past 18 months. Several of those people said diversity took a backseat to the company’s needs to hire quickly.

Liane Hornsey, Uber’s senior vice president of HR, said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday that she’s working to clean up Uber’s cultural problems, including its approach to recruiting. Hornsey, who joined the company this year, said Uber revised 1,500 job descriptions to remove unconscious bias from the language, will hold job interview training for women in tech and is ensuring its panel of interviewers is diverse. Uber plans to release a diversity report for the first time next week. “We’re spending a good deal of time reflecting on what will lead to true diversity and inclusion,” Hornsey wrote in an email. “Clearly, this matters a lot to all of us and must underpin everything we do—it’s the foundation of positive cultural change.”

Bloomberg spoke with about a dozen current and former Uber staffers familiar with the company’s hiring process, including several members of the recruiting team. They asked not to be identified because many have employment contracts that bar them from criticizing the company. Their experiences illustrate how a startup defined on breaking rules and expanding at any cost can develop into a homogenous work environment, where discrimination goes unchecked. Uber, valued at $69 billion, has become the latest test case for Silicon Valley’s enduring inclusion issues.
Uber is under enormous scrutiny following recent accusations of a toxic and sexist workplace. Susan Fowler, a former software engineer at the company, wrote a blog post last month alleging that her boss at Uber propositioned her for sex and was protected by HR. She also said women were discriminated against throughout the technical group.

The ride-hailing giant is now trying to rehabilitate its image and ease employee unrest. It hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the sexual harassment claims and the company’s culture. The results of this probe are expected by the end of April and will be released to the public, according to Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member.

The company all-hands meeting each Tuesday has become a weekly airing of grievances, where Kalanick has offered several tearful apologies. The 40-year-old CEO delivered one such atonement publicly after Bloomberg published a video showing him arguing with an Uber driver. Kalanick said he needed “leadership help” and would hire an operating chief. Some insiders are pushing for a strong female leader to take the role.

As the company prepares a full diversity report, it has presented one stat: 15 percent of engineers, scientists and product managers are women. This is lower than other startups, and even its bigger and older tech peers, including Facebook Inc., which has struggled with its own diversity hiring initiatives. Airbnb Inc., which was founded around the same time as Uber, said 26 percent of technical employees are women. Lyft Inc., which is Uber’s main competitor in the U.S., said it plans to release its first diversity report in the coming weeks.
Companies that have successfully improved diversity numbers typically take a systematic approach to diversity hiring processes and goals, make their inclusion commitments clear and reach out to and recruit from diverse professional organizations, said Andrea Hoffman, founder of the diversity consulting firm Culture Shift Labs. Those initiatives must be driven by corporate chiefs, she said. “This is a multifaceted approach that starts at the top.”

In the occasional meeting between Kalanick and some members of Uber’s recruiting team, the CEO would strike an upbeat tone toward diversity. But when staff would propose investing more in that area, recruiters became frustrated after he repeatedly postponed decisions, said a person familiar with the gatherings. “Let’s keep jamming on this,” Kalanick would say, deploying a common Uber-ism.

Kalanick would also refer to the company’s 14 cultural values, which include “meritocracy and toe-stepping,” meaning good ideas are valued above all else. Employees were evaluated in performance reviews on how well they exhibited these values. None of the 14 values refer specifically to diversity or inclusion. Kalanick often said diversity comes in many different forms and resisted the idea of prioritizing race or gender, according to two people. He’s said Uber should look for the “best minds.”

“The culture that Uber’s wanted to build is not one that’s designed to be inclusive and equitable”


In 2015, as Uber was expanding worldwide and more than doubling headcount, it hired Damien Hooper-Campbell as global diversity and inclusion lead. Hooper-Campbell, who is black, has extensive experience in the area. He was an assistant director of minority initiatives at Harvard Business School, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice president focused on inclusion efforts and a diversity strategist at Google. Renee Atwood, Uber’s former HR head, held his appointment up as proof that the company was working to create a more diverse culture in a 2015 Wired story.

Hooper-Campbell was initially tasked with planning diversity recruitment programs and outlining goals to make Uber more hospitable to minorities working there, said two former employees. The move was encouraging to his fellow recruiters, who were frustrated by a lack of leadership on diversity projects at the company’s San Francisco headquarters.

But Hooper-Campbell’s job soon changed. He was dispatched to Oakland to serve as a face of the company to local officials and help oversee logistics around the new office, the people said. “His role was in constant flux,” Sean Cervera, a former colleague on Uber’s recruiting team, recalled in a blog post this month. Within a year, Hooper-Campbell left to become chief diversity officer at EBay Inc. A spokeswoman for EBay declined to make him available for an interview.

Cervera wrote that he had been enlisted to help Uber find more diverse recruits in technical roles but was only allowed to spend 10 percent of his time on inclusion initiatives. Cervera, who now works on inclusion recruiting programs at Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn, declined to comment.

At times, Uber’s recruiting leadership seemed to be preoccupied with gimmicks. Last year, Jim Baaden, the global head of recruiting, hosted several events for job candidates in which attendees were asked to break into small groups and put on blindfolds, said five people familiar with the proceedings. Candidates were instructed to pluck sateen blindfolds from a cardboard box and silently arrange puzzle pieces into molded shapes. The Uber staff hosting the event set a timer to seven minutes, while they clapped vigorously and blasted pop music from a stereo. Afterward, an Uber recruiting coordinator explained that the purpose of the exercise was to see how applicants approach problems in a chaotic situation. The exercise, which is called Colourblind, is also used by other companies as a test of teamwork.

Uber missed an important opportunity last year by not placing a higher priority on diversity, said Joelle Emerson, who runs diversity consulting firm Paradigm. Uber’s staff more than doubled again in 2016, exceeding 12,000 employees today. “The culture that Uber’s wanted to build is not one that’s designed to be inclusive and equitable and set everyone up for success. And I think that is the underlying problem,” Emerson said. “Having a more diverse organization can help drive a more positive culture.”

After repeated vacillations by Kalanick, Uber eventually committed cash to diversity programs. In October, Baaden distributed $25,000 apiece to several identity-based employee resource groups at Uber, catering to LGBT, female engineers and others, a person familiar with the matter said. A few months later, the company hired Bernard Coleman, the former chief diversity officer for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, as head of diversity and inclusion.

Baaden pointed to the addition of Coleman in a recent interview as evidence that the company cares about diversity. “You bring in someone like that, the expectation is that it continues to be an important consideration for us as we invest and think about programs and think about different ways to engage a diverse population of both employees and talent,” Baaden said.

But Mitch and Freada Kapor, a pair of early Uber investors, believe the company isn’t doing enough. Uber has had “countless opportunities to do the right thing,” they wrote in a blog post. “Uber’s outsize success in terms of growth of market share, revenues and valuation are impressive, but can never excuse a culture plagued by disrespect, exclusionary cliques, lack of diversity, and tolerance for bullying and harassment of every form.”

A week after their rebuke, Kalanick asked for the resignation of a newly appointed senior executive, who was investigated by his former employer over a sexual harassment claim. Uber recruiters weren’t aware of the issue before he was hired. The executive, Amit Singhal, denied the allegation. Hornsey, the new HR head, said on Tuesday that the company has been talking with the Kapors and will take their input into account. On Thursday, Kalanick met with the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

The scandals are beginning to take a toll on Uber’s ability to recruit talent. Cassie Vance, a brand strategy expert in San Francisco, said she was approached by the ride-hailing giant this month about a job opportunity. “Under normal circumstances, I’d love to have a conversation regarding a role like this, because it sounds right up my alley. But you and I both know these are not normal circumstances,” Vance wrote to the recruiter, according to a copy of the LinkedIn message seen by Bloomberg. “To say that I’d be embarrassed to have Uber on my résumé would be a gross understatement. I know I’m not the only person that feels this way, and if you ask me, there’s no marketing strategy that is going to get you guys out of the hole you’ve dug yourselves.”

Uber Rival Grab Raising $1.5 Billion in New Funding Round.
Grab, Uber Technologies Inc.’s largest rival in Southeast Asia, plans to raise more than $1.5 billion in a new funding round backed by SoftBank Group Corp., people familiar with the matter said.

SoftBank is pledging about $1 billion in the ride-sharing company backed by Tiger Global Management and GGV Capital, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. It wasn’t clear if the money was coming from the Japanese company itself or its yet-to-close SoftBank Vision Fund. Grab’s financing could be a record for Southeast Asia, eclipsing the $750 million the company raised in September in a round said to give it a then valuation of more than $3 billion.

Grab, which this week announced plans to expand to its seventh country in the region, is racing against Uber and Go-Jek Indonesia PT to cast its net across more cities and drum up business for its nascent payments platform. The companies have been engaged in a cash-burning battle underpinned by their ability to raise funds and expand in one of the fastest growing markets globally.

Grab declined to comment. SoftBank wasn’t immediately able to comment.

SoftBank’s billionaire Chairman Masayoshi Son is trying to close his $100 billion Vision Fund, which is being backed by his own company, along with money from Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development Co. Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison may invest $1 billion each, people familiar with the matter have said.

As SoftBank closes in on the first round of the fund, it has cut investment deals, including for satellite startup OneWeb Ltd., that it said will likely be included in the fund.

Grab has pledged $700 million in investment in Indonesia in the next four years, seeking to win over a market with 260 million people. Indonesia is Grab’s largest market, where the four-year-old company saw more than 600 percent growth last year.

It’s hiring more than 800 new research and development staff in six centers over the next two years, including new facilities in Bangalore and Ho Chi Minh City. The company has said it is willing to set aside much as $100 million to bankroll early-stage startups in mobile and financial services technology in Indonesia.

Grab’s September fundraising was also led by SoftBank.
Trump tastes failure as U.S. House healthcare bill collapses.
President Donald Trump suffered a stunning political setback on Friday in a Congress controlled by his own party when Republican leaders pulled legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies.
President Donald Trump suffered a stunning political setback on Friday in a Congress controlled by his own party when Republican leaders pulled legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies.

House of Representatives leaders yanked the bill after a rebellion by Republican moderates and the party's most conservative lawmakers left them short of votes, ensuring that Trump's first major legislative initiative since taking office on Jan. 20 ended in failure. Democrats were unified against it.

House Republicans had planned a vote on the measure after Trump late on Thursday cut off negotiations with Republicans who had balked at the plan and issued an ultimatum to vote on Friday, win or lose. But desperate lobbying by the White House and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was unable to round up the 216 votes needed for passage.

"We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process," Trump told reporters at the White House, although he sought to shift the blame to the Democrats even though his party controls the White House, the House and the Senate.

With Friday's legislative collapse, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - remains in place despite seven years of Republican promises to dismantle it.

The healthcare failure called into question not only Trump's ability to get other key parts of his agenda, including tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending, through Congress, but the Republican Party's capacity to govern effectively.

Neither Trump nor Ryan indicated any plans to try to tackle healthcare legislation again anytime soon. Trump said he would turn his attention to getting "big tax cuts" through Congress, another tricky proposition.

Republican supporters said the legislation would achieve their goal of rolling back the government's "nanny state" role in healthcare. The White House made undoing Obamacare its top priority when Trump took office two months ago.

But the White House and House leaders were unable to come up with a plan that satisfied the clashing interests of moderates and conservatives, despite Trump's vaunted image as a deal maker.

Amid a chaotic scramble for votes, Ryan, who championed the bill, met with Trump at the White House. Ryan said he recommended that it be withdrawn from the House floor because he did not have the votes to pass it, and Trump agreed.

"We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short," Trump said. "With no Democrat support we couldn't quite get there."

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the bill failed "because of two traits that have plagued the Trump presidency since he took office: incompetence and broken promises."

Democrats said the bill would take away medical insurance from millions of Americans and leave the more-than-$3 trillion U.S. healthcare system in disarray.

And some moderate Republicans opposed the bill because of worries that millions of America would be hurt.

"There were things in this bill that I didn't particularly like," Trump added, without specifying what those were, but expressed confidence in Ryan's leadership.

"Perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes," said Trump, who had posted multiple tweets throughout March proclaiming that "Obamacare is imploding" and repeatedly saying that Republicans were coming together to pass the bill.

Friday's events cast doubt on whether Ryan can get major legislation approved by fractious Republican lawmakers.

"Obamacare's the law of the land," Ryan added. "We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future."

"A LITTLE SURPRISED"

Members of the Freedom Caucus, the House's most conservative members, were instrumental in the bill's failure, opposing it among other reasons because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare.

Trump said he was disappointed and "a little surprised" with the Freedom Caucus opposition.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said under the Republican legislation 14 million people would lose medical coverage by next year and more than 24 million would be uninsured in 2026.

News that the bill had been pulled before a final vote was greeted initially with a small sigh of relief by U.S. equity investors, who earlier in the week had been fretful that an outright defeat would damage Trump's other priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending.

Benchmark U.S. stock market indexes ended the session mixed after rallying back from session lows following the news. The S&P 500 Index ended fractionally lower, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped about 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose about 0.2 percent.

Shares of hospital operators finished sharply higher, with the S&P healthcare facilities index up 2.7 percent, while the S&P 500 healthcare sector edged down 0.03 percent. The dollar strengthened modestly on the news, and U.S. Treasury bond yields edged up from session lows.

Trump said he would be "totally open" to working with Democrats on healthcare "when they all become civilized." House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said working to lower prescription drug prices was one area of possible cooperation with Republicans.

Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher said before the bill was pulled that voting it down would be "neutering Trump" while empowering his opponents.

"You don't cut the balls off a bull and then expect that he can go out and get the job done," Rohrabacher told Reuters. "This will emasculate Trump and we can't do that. ... If we bring this down now, Trump will have lost all of his leverage to pass whatever bill it is, whether it's the tax bill or whatever reforms that he wants."

Representative Joe Barton of Texas, when asked why his fellow Republicans were so united over the past seven years to dump Obamacare only to fall apart when they actually do something about it, said, "Sometimes you're playing fantasy football and sometimes you’re in the real game."

Obamacare boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law.

The House plan would have rescinded a range of taxes created by Obamacare, ended a penalty on people who refuse to obtain health insurance, and ended Obamacare's income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax credits

It also would have ended Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid state-federal insurance program for the poor, cut future federal Medicaid funding and let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients.

House leaders agreed to a series of last-minute changes to try to win over disgruntled conservatives, including ending the Obamacare requirement that insurers cover certain "essential benefits" such as maternity care, mental health services and prescription drug coverage.
With healthcare bill dead, Republicans turn to taxes.
After failing to repeal Obamacare, Republicans in the U.S. Congress quickly pivoted on Friday to President Donald Trump's next priority: overhauling the federal tax code, but their plan has already split the business community.

Division among Republicans was the chief cause of the embarrassing setback on Obamacare, and similar fault lines have been evident for months in the Republicans' tax plan, mainly over an untested proposal to use the tax code to boost exports.

House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady conceded the demise of a Republican plan to roll back Obamacare could make the path to tax reform harder. "This made a big challenge more challenging. But it’s not insurmountable," he told Fox News after Ryan canceled a vote on an Obamacare rollback bill.

But Brady said he and House Speaker Paul Ryan are all-in on tax reform.

Brady said House Republicans plan to begin moving on tax reform this spring and to pass legislation before Congress's summer recess in late July.

"We’re going to work with the administration to get this done,” he said.

Trump has been unclear about his position on the most problematic feature of the House Republicans' tax "blueprint," a proposal known as the border adjustment tax that would cut taxes on exports and raise them on imports.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that tax reform in many ways is "a lot simpler" than healthcare reform.

"We're able to take the tax code and redesign things and I think there is very, very strong support," Mnuchin said at an event hosted by news website Axios.

Comprehensive tax reform is a policy goal so complex that it has defied successive Congresses and presidents since 1986 when it was last accomplished under former President Ronald Reagan.

The U.S. tax code is riddled with narrow subsidies and loopholes, many of them deeply embedded in the economy and defended by the interests they benefit, such as the mortgage interest deduction and the business interest deductibility.

Brady's panel has been working on a plan since mid-2016 that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, end taxing foreign profits for U.S.-based multinationals and cut other tax rates for businesses and investors.

The plan has divided businesses, prompting import-dependent industries to warn of higher prices for consumer goods from clothing and electronics to gasoline.

Brady has been adamant that border adjustment will be part of the House tax reform, saying earlier this week that the provision was "a given" for final legislation but would include a transition period for import-heavy industries.

Trump disappointed House conservatives blocked healthcare bill.
President Donald Trump said on Friday that he was disappointed that a conservative faction in the House of Representatives blocked his healthcare legislation and said "we learned a lot about loyalty" from the effort.

Speaking in the Oval Office after a stunning political setback, Trump said the healthcare effort was a victim of stalwart Democratic opposition and any future healthcare legislation would likely need Democratic support.

He also said he was surprised and disappointed by the opposition from the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservatives who prevented Republicans from using their majority in the House to pass the legislation.

Asked if he felt betrayed by the Freedom Caucus, Trump said he did not.

No, I'm not betrayed. They're friends of mine. I'm disappointed because we could have had it. So I'm disappointed. I'm a little surprised, to be honest with you," Trump said.

"We really had it. It was pretty much there, within grasp. But I'll tell you what's going to come of it is a better bill...because there were things in this bill that I didn't particularly like. If both parties could get together and do real healthcare, that's the best thing," he said.

Trump, a New York businessman who won election Nov. 8 based in part on promises to get big deals through Congress, cast the failure as a learning experience.

“We all learned a lot. We learned a lot about loyalty," Trump said. "We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the Senate and the House."

Trump also expressed confidence in House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was seen as the main backer of the legislation. Ryan personally delivered the news earlier in the day to Trump that there were not enough votes to pass it.

"I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very, very hard. A lot of different groups. He's got a lot of factions. And there's been a long history of liking and disliking, even within the Republican Party, long before I got here," he said. "I'm not going to speak badly about anybody within the party."

Trump has privately told confidants he wished he had done tax reform first instead of getting immersed in the difficult effort to overhaul President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which passed without Republican support in 2010.

"We'll probably be going right now for tax reform," Trump said, saying he wanted "big tax cuts and tax reform. That will be next."
Speaker Ryan dented by healthcare debacle, but keeps support.
U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday acknowledged the unthinkable for a Republican leader: he could not deliver the votes to repeal and replace Obamacare, even though he and his fellow Republicans had vowed to do so for seven years.

Nevertheless, Ryan's job did not seem to be under immediate threat, at least not in the House of Representatives he leads.

Ryan's long-time news media nemesis, the website Breitbart, said Republicans were "openly discussing" finding a replacement for him after he pulled a bill to roll back Obamacare from the House floor just minutes before an intensely awaited final vote. The Breitbart article did not quote anyone by name.

In the House, just after the bill was pulled, several lawmakers brushed aside suggestions that the failure spelled trouble for Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate, who many have speculated has presidential ambitions.

Ryan, 47, has been speaker since October 2015. Under the law, he is next in line to the presidency after Vice President Mike Pence.

Republican Representative Justin Amash, a harsh critic of the ill-fated healthcare bill, told reporters, "We can do better with the legislative process." But, he added, "Nobody is talking about" trying to oust Ryan as speaker.

Amash had disparagingly dubbed the Republican healthcare bill "Obamacare 2.0," after Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.

Amash is a member of the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, which in 2015 ousted Ryan's predecessor as speaker, John Boehner, from the post. The caucus played a key role in the demise of the healthcare bill.

Ryan chose to make healthcare reform the first target on a list of legislative goals for the new Republican-majority Congress. He admitted on Friday that he was disappointed by the outcome.

Republicans faced resistance to the healthcare bill from both conservatives and moderates, making the process of winning passage difficult for the leadership.

Republican Representative Joe Barton, asked about the impact of Friday's loss on Ryan, told reporters: "The speaker is a human being. He's not Superman."

Republican Representative Barry Loudermilk, who backed the healthcare bill, said he didn't think the loss weakened the speaker's hand.

One Republican lawmaker who has been considered potential speaker material, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, effusively praised Ryan, saying he had shown "phenomenal leadership."

"It is my hope that we can regroup and rally behind him (Ryan) and the president as a conference to deliver on our promise" to dismantle Obamacare, Hensarling said in a statement.
Iran denies harassing U.S. warships in Gulf, warns of clashes.
Iran denied on Saturday U.S. accusations that its fast-attack boats were "harassing" warships at the mouth of the Gulf, and said Washington would be responsible for any clashes in the key oil shipping route.

U.S. Navy commanders earlier accused Iran of jeopardizing international navigation by "harassing" warships passing through the Strait of Hormuz and said future incidents could result in miscalculation and lead to an armed clash.

They spoke after the U.S. aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush confronted what one of the commanding officers described as two sets of Iranian Navy fast-attack boats that had approached a U.S.-led, five-vessel flotilla as it entered the Strait on Tuesday on a journey from the Indian Ocean into the Gulf.

It was the first time a U.S. carrier entered the narrow waterway, where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass, since President Donald Trump took office in January pledging a tougher U.S. stance towards Iran.

In Tehran, Brigadier General Masoud Jazayeri, deputy chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, said the U.S. claims of the confrontation in the Gulf were based on "false reports or ulterior motives", the state news agency IRNA reported.

"We emphasize that the Americans would be responsible for any unrest in the Persian Gulf, and again warn that the U.S. military must change its behavior," Jazayeri said, without elaborating.

U.S. commanders earlier said Tuesday's incident, in which the George H.W. Bush sent helicopter gunships to hover over the Iranian speedboats as some came as close as 950 yards (870 meters) from the aircraft carrier, ended without a shot being fired.

But it underscored growing tension between the United States and Iran since the election of Trump, who has condemned the 2015 nuclear deal that his predecessor Barack Obama and leaders of five other world powers struck with Tehran and labeled the Islamic Republic "the number one terrorist state".

The encounter with Iranian Navy boats occurred as the USS George H.W. Bush was en route to the northern part of the Gulf to participate in U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

Earlier in March, Iran disputed the U.S. account of another confrontation in the Strait of Hormuz between its speedboats and a U.S. Navy vessel.
Trump greenlights Keystone XL pipeline, but obstacles loom | Reuters

By Jeff Mason and Ethan Lou | WASHINGTON/CALGARY, Alberta
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration approved TransCanada Corp's (TRP.TO) Keystone XL pipeline on Friday, cheering the oil industry and angering environmentalists even as further hurdles for the controversial project loom.

The approval reverses a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project, but the company still needs to win financing, acquire local permits, and fend off likely legal challenges for the pipeline to be built.

"TransCanada will finally be allowed to complete this long-overdue project with efficiency and with speed," Trump said in the Oval Office before turning to ask TransCanada Chief Executive Officer Russell Girling when construction would start.

"We've got some work to do in Nebraska to get our permits there," Girling replied.

"Nebraska?" Trump said. "I'll call Nebraska."

Trump announced the presidential permit for Keystone XL at the White House with Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions, standing nearby. He said the project would lower consumer fuel prices, create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.

The pipeline linking Canadian oil sands to U.S. refiners had been blocked by Obama, who said it would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute to emissions linked to global warming.

Trump, however, campaigned on a promise to approve it, and he signed an executive order soon after taking office in January to advance the project.

TransCanada's U.S.-listed shares (TRP.N) dipped 5 cents to close at $46.21 on Friday.

JOBS

Trump has claimed the project would create 28,000 jobs in the United States. But a 2014 State Department study predicted just 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs.



The president said he would get in touch with Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts later in the day.

TransCanada applied to the Nebraska Public Service Commission in February for approval of the pipeline's route through the state. The company said it expects that process to conclude this year.

Ricketts said in a statement posted on Twitter that the project would help his state.

"I have full confidence that the Public Service Commission will conduct a thorough and fair review of the application," he said.

The White House has said the pipeline is exempt from a Trump executive order requiring new pipelines to be made from U.S. steel, because much of the pipe for the project has already been built and stockpiled.

"As we move forward, we'll continue to look to buy the rest of the materials we need from ... American manufacturers. We'll put American workers to work," Girling told reporters.

Environmental groups vowed to fight it.

Greenpeace said it would pressure banks to withhold financing for the multibillion-dollar project, and others said they would fight the pipeline in court.

"We'll use every tool in the kit," said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Since Obama had nixed the pipeline based on an environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department in early 2014, opponents will likely argue in court that Trump cannot reverse the decision without conducting a new assessment.

CHALLENGES

Fred Jauss, partner at the international law firm Dorsey & Whitney and a former attorney with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said local permitting would also be a challenge.

"The Presidential Permit is only one part of a web of federal, state, and local permits that must be obtained prior to starting construction," he said. "Other federal agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers, state regulatory commissions, and even local planning boards may have requirements that need to be fulfilled by Keystone prior to construction."

"In addition, TransCanada may still need to reach deals with hundreds of potentially affected landowners on the pipeline’s route. There is a lot of work ahead for TransCanada.”

The Keystone XL pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Canada's oil sands in Alberta into Nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico.

The project could be a boon for Canada, which has struggled to bring its vast oil reserves to market.

"Our government has always been supportive of the Keystone XL pipeline and we are pleased with the U.S. decision," said a spokesman for Canada's minister of natural resources. "The importance of a common, continental energy market cannot be overstated."

The president of the American Petroleum Institute, Jack Gerard, said the approval was "welcome news" and would bolster U.S. energy security.

Expedited approval of projects is part of Trump's approach to a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail. The White House is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for other infrastructure projects, which can sometimes take years to go through a regulatory maze.

TransCanada tried for more than five years to build the 1,179-mile (1,897-km) pipeline, until Obama rejected it in 2015. The company resubmitted its application for the project in January, after Trump signed the executive order smoothing its path.

Obamacare exploding? Maybe just a slow burn.
Obamacare exploding? Maybe just a slow burn | Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that Obamacare was "exploding" after Republican lawmakers shelved legislation that would have dismantled the healthcare law.

That's not going to happen this month. Probably not even this year.

The more than 12 million people who bought 2017 health insurance plans on HealthCare.gov and other websites the law created are not in danger of losing their healthcare or having their premiums go up right now, experts say.

But 2018 is another story.

Republicans could choose to pass a budget that defunds Obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies, which help low-income people cover out-of-pocket and other medical costs. But that would be highly unpopular among consumers who would likely blame the president and Congress for skyrocketing healthcare costs, experts said.

"That is one of the ways that is available to monkey wrench the Affordable Care Act," said Morgan Tilleman, an associate with the law firm Foley & Lardner, who represents insurers.

Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature legislation created by the Affordable Care Act of 2010, has had a tough beginning. The mix of sick and healthy customers has been worse than expected, and premium rates on the individual insurance market went up 25 percent this year.

Other parts of the law, like the expansion of Medicaid to enhance coverage for the poor, and changes to allow young people to stay on their parents' health plans, have been popular. And the defeat of the bill is a win for the hospitals that have benefited from those increased Medicaid dollars.

But many counties across the country have only one insurer, after Humana Inc, Aetna Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc pulled out after reporting hundreds of millions of dollars of losses.

The insurers who are left, Anthem Inc and other BlueCross BlueShield insurers across the country, as well as smaller players like Centene Corp and Molina Healthcare Inc need to decide in the next few months where to sell insurance and how much to charge.

And that is where the market's slow burn takes off, with insurers leaving and premiums rising.

Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds who focuses on health care, said that for consumers, 2018 looks uncertain, with a "death spiral" of decreasing competition and increasing premium rates ramping up.

LOOKING TO 2018

After the failed Republican effort to push through the bill, insurers are looking at changes to help 2018, America's Health Insurance Plans spokeswoman Kristine Grow said.

That includes the market's cost-sharing subsidies as well as other government payments for sicker-than-usual customers and finalizing a rule the Trump administration proposed that addresses issues insurers say drives up costs.

The Trump administration could do some of that itself if it wants to, such as using its regulatory authority to adjust the formula for how it compensates insurers for the sickest people, Elizabeth Carpenter at healthcare consultancy and research firm Avalere Health said.

But it is unknown if the administration will try to work within the law's existing framework or take actions to undermine it and blame the Democrats for its failure.

"If they fail to act and they don't act in an appropriate way, that will further destabilize the marketplace," Dr. Mario Molina, CEO of Molina Healthcare, said. Molina's enrollment ballooned to 1 million exchange enrollees this year and the company is weighing if it will submit plans for next year.

The administration could also decide to not enforce the individual mandate, which requires that everyone purchase health insurance or pay a fine. It already took steps to erode that provision last month, when it backed off implementing tougher oversight that was due to go into effect for 2016 taxes.

Experts said the individual mandate still cost less than purchasing insurance, but as it increases each year more young and healthy people would have incentive to join the healthcare market, helping to offset the cost of sicker patients.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 14 million more people would be uninsured under the Republican bill next year, with most of the increase coming from the repeal of the penalty associated with the individual mandate.

It's unclear what the Republicans will do. Trump said this bill had been shelved but that Republicans would end up with a "great" healthcare bill in the future, but for now that they are moving onto tax reform.

Until they do that, they will have to work within the 2010 Affordable Care Act. It can also undercut the healthcare law through regulatory authority at the Department of Health and Human Services.

By James Oliphant | WASHINGTON
In the end, the Closer couldn’t close the deal.

For President Donald Trump, the collapse on Friday of his first legislative priority, a healthcare reform bill, was an embarrassing loss of face after he and his administration insisted up until the time of the vote by the U.S. House of Representatives that there was enough Republican support.

It brings into question the neophyte president’s ability to move big-ticket legislation through Congress. And for a celebrity businessman who brands himself a deal-maker and fixer, it casts doubt over his ability to deliver on his bold "drain-the-swamp" promises to shake up Washington.

The White House wants to advance, among other things, tax reform and a massive infrastructure package this year, but now it must address whether a change of approach is needed and whether congressional allies such as House Speaker Paul Ryan can be counted on to deliver.

"This is the most consequential day of Trump's presidency and it's not just a failure, it's a stunning failure,” Charlie Sykes, an influential Wisconsin Republican political commentator and frequent Trump critic, said on Twitter.

Trump appeared to chalk up the loss in part to his own inexperience after House leaders pulled their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare following defections by both moderate and far-right Republican members who were unmoved by Trump's ultimatum to vote for the plan or live with the current system.

“We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process,” Trump said after the bill was withdrawn, adding that he would move forward with other priorities.

It was yet another setback for an administration barely two months in office that has already seen its national security adviser resign, had its immigration restrictions struck down in courts, and faces a barrage of questions about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

Trump’s hallmark salesmanship seemed to abandon him this week. Although he furiously courted the hard-line conservatives opposed to the reform bill, they largely refused to yield, and in the process he alienated moderates who initially supported the bill.

The president then switched tactics and gave up trying to bring the conservative opponents into the fold, instead delivering an ultimatum that all Republicans needed to back the bill. That did not work either.

Trump also failed to persuade the American public that the bill was an improvement over the one it would have repealed and replaced: the Affordable Care Act - the signature domestic achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Polls showed the replacement bill to be deeply unpopular, and conservative Republicans complained that their offices were being deluged by calls from constituents opposing it.

“This demonstrates that campaigning and legislating are two different things,” said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Representative Joe Barton of Texas blamed the failure on Republicans who control the White House, Senate and the House still learning how to govern after eight years of Obama.

"Sometimes you’re playing fantasy football and sometimes you’re in the real game,” Barton told Reuters.

Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida called it “a big blow" for the Republican agenda.

Trump’s efforts to engage the bill’s opponents at times seemed to muddy the process further, as he largely cut Ryan out of negotiations. (Ryan didn't seem to mind, calling Trump a "great closer.")

But even as Trump offered concessions, conservatives did not budge and moderates were angered.

Stuart Diamond, a professor who teaches negotiation at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump’s strong-arm tactics backfired.

“Threats don't work in general,” he said. “They cause damage to relationships. They definitely don't work in a situation with a lot of different stakeholders, where the power is distributed.”

ESCAPING A LOOMING DISASTER

After the bill was revised along Trump’s specifications, the Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the financial impact of proposed legislation, determined that the bill would deprive 24 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit.

The CBO said the bill would not affect the number of uninsured but it would reduce the budget deficit significantly less than the original bill, troubling fiscal hawks. Even as Trump and the White House pushed harder, opposition to the bill among the rank and file rose.

Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is also a small-business owner, said Trump was still getting used to governing. “There are parallels between government and business, but they are not exactly the same.”

The lesson from the debacle, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was an aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, is that the White House needs to take a firmer hand in crafting legislative strategy. On healthcare, Trump largely deferred to Ryan’s office, which drafted the bill in secret, sowing mistrust among conservatives.

Congress now faces arguably an even tougher legislative reform: overhauling the tax code, which has not been done since 1986 and involves navigating a snake pit of competing special interests. Like Trump's healthcare proposal, it could struggle against public opinion, with Democrats likely to cast it as a Republican giveaway to the rich.

There was also a feeling among some Republicans that they had escaped a looming disaster. Even if the bill had passed the House, it faced a radical overhaul in the Senate, meaning both chambers would have been tied up battling over the bill for weeks, perhaps months.

And if it became law and millions of voters lost health insurance, some Republicans feared they could suffer at the polls.

Instead, those Republicans have to hope voters will not punish them for failing to deliver on a promise they had been making since Obamacare was passed in 2010, and that they will still believe this president when he says he can strike a deal.

“This is a promise the GOP made to voters. They need to get it right,” said Rachel Bovard, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as she urged Republicans to "start over."

It is unclear when that could happen. "This bill is dead,” said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, a member of the House leadership team.

Planned Parenthood sees brief reprieve after healthcare bill yanked

Planned Parenthood, the national health organization that would have lost federal funding under sweeping healthcare overhaul legislation, views the withdrawal of the bill on Friday as a temporary reprieve, not the end of a threat to its existence.

Officials of the organization - long a target of those who oppose its abortion services - anticipate further attempts by Republicans to curb its participation in federally funded public health programs, a major source of its funding.

In a major setback for Republican President Donald Trump, U.S. House of Representatives leaders pulled the healthcare bill after a rebellion by Republican moderates and the party's most conservative lawmakers left them short of votes. Democrats were unified against it.

Planned Parenthood leaders will meet in Washington next week to plan their strategy for coming rounds in what they see as a protracted fight.

"It's one good night's sleep, and then we have to see what they are going to cook up," Chris Charbonneau, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands, said in a phone interview. "They're trying to find some vehicle that they could hook some Planned Parenthood defund(ing) to."

Many Republicans oppose the organization, some on religious grounds, because its healthcare services include abortions, although it receives no federal funding or reimbursement for abortions, as stipulated by federal law.

The federal funding it receives is primarily through reimbursement via Medicaid and the Title X Family Planning grant program for its care for low-income patients.

Abortion opponents said Republican leaders had promised for years to end federal reimbursement for Planned Parenthood, and that voters would continue to hold them to this. Before winning the presidential election in November, Trump had also promised to defund Planned Parenthood, and fought to get the healthcare bill passed.

"I'm confident the Republicans in Congress and the president will move ahead and defund Planned Parenthood," said Joe Pojman, executive director of the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life.

The issue "is so dear to the electorate who put the Republicans and president in office," he said after the bill was pulled.

On the other side of the issue, Georges Benjamin, the American Public Health Association's executive director, welcomed the withdrawal of the legislation, and said the renewed public attention on Planned Parenthood may make future efforts to limit its funding more difficult.

"I think in many ways it's going to be harder for them to go after Planned Parenthood, not that they won't," he said in a telephone interview.

"I hope people recognize that Planned Parenthood did more than abortions, that they recognize it has a broader portfolio," he said, referring to services such as cancer screenings provided by the organization.

PUBLIC SUPPORT

The proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA) would have repealed many parts of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which Democratic President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010.

Charbonneau and other Planned Parenthood officials pointed to a widespread outpouring of public opposition to AHCA as one of the reasons that its moderate Republican backers could not reach a compromise with members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who demanded a complete evisceration of Obamacare.

"The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!" Trump wrote in a message on Twitter on Friday morning.Public opinion polls found the AHCA bill was unpopular among Americans, including Republican voters, and that there was broad public support for funding some of Planned Parenthood's work. In a Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted last month, almost half of 5,459 American adults surveyed said Planned Parenthood should receive federal funding; about a third said they should not.

Even so, about 70 percent of those people said Planned Parenthood should get the money when they were asked about specific services such as free cancer screenings, contraception and prenatal care. Women were significantly more likely than men to think the organization deserved funding.

The Planned Parenthood Federation of America had described the Republicans' proposed law as containing a "long list of anti-women's health provisions" in a statement earlier this week. The federation's president, Cecile Richards, cheered its withdrawal on Friday.

The organization said that 2.5 million men, women and children rely on Planned Parenthood for cancer screenings, medical testing, contraception, abortions and other healthcare services each year at around 700 health centers around the country.

The warnings were echoed by two dozen national public health organizations, including the American Public Health Association, the American Nurses Association and the American College of Nurse-Midwives, in a letter to U.S. lawmakers in February. They argued that in some parts of the country, particularly rural areas, Planned Parenthood was the only nearby provider of health services.

North Dakota governor approves concealed guns without a permit

North Dakotans will no longer need a permit to carry a concealed weapon after Republican Governor Doug Burgum signed legislation lifting restrictions, a victory for gun rights advocates that came a week after South Dakota's governor vetoed a similar bill.

The law, which takes effect on Aug. 1, mandates that gun owners only need a North Dakota driver's license or state identification card for at least a year before they can carry a concealed firearm in public.

Under current regulations, applicants must take a test to obtain a permit which entails fees of more than $100.

The measure, signed late on Thursday, was approved by the

Republican-controlled legislature despite concerns over public safety if the state made it easier to carry hidden weapons. Advocates framed the issue in terms of the constitutional right to bear arms.

"North Dakota has a rich heritage of hunting and a culture of deep respect for firearm safety," Burgum said. "As a hunter and gun owner myself, I strongly support gun rights for law-abiding citizens."

The legislation makes North Dakota the 12th state to allow gun owners to carry their weapons without a concealed-carry permit, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which opposes the practice.

"There's kind of a mythology around this idea that if you're going armed in public, you're going to be able to save the day, but actually it's more likely you will get yourself hurt or hurt an innocent person," said Laura Cutilletta, a managing attorney with the center.

Burgum said his state's bill would not make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Firearms dealers still must comply with federal background checks to ensure purchasers are not convicted felons, he said.

Last week, South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, vetoed a measure to allow carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. He defended existing rules as reasonable, saying lawful gun owners have easily obtained concealed carry permits.

Last year, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the U.S. Constitution does not grant any fundamental right to carry a concealed firearm in public.

The ruling upheld the authority of officials to grant permits to those facing a specific danger but only applied to states in the western United States.

The U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 declined to accept a case that involved the issue of whether firearm owners have a constitutional right to carry concealed guns.

Thirty-one states have "open carry" laws, allowing handgun owners to carry weapons in full view without a license, according to the center.

More Americans reach for a daily coffee in 2017: NCA

By Marcy Nicholson | AUSTIN, Texas
More Americans are drinking a daily cup of coffee in 2017, a reversal of four years of declines, as gourmet brews gain in popularity, according to an industry group's report released on Saturday.

"More of us are drinking coffee, and younger consumers appear to be leading the charge," said National Coffee Association USA (NCA) Chief Executive Officer Bill Murray.

"A steadily growing taste for gourmet varieties is also driving a wider trend toward specialty beverages," he said.

Gourmet coffee is brewed from what survey participants view to be premium beans and includes espresso-based drinks like cappuccinos.

The National Coffee Drinking Trends report showed that 62 percent of more than 3,000 people who participated in the online survey said they had drunk coffee the previous day, which is interpreted as daily consumption.

This was up from 57 percent in 2016, said the report, which was released at the coffee association's conference in Austin, Texas.

The increase appeared in all age groups, with 37 percent of 13-to-18-year-olds reporting they had a coffee the day prior, up from 31 percent in 2016.

Daily consumption spread to 64 percent of 40-to-59-year-olds from 53 percent last year, but this brought levels around those of 2014, according to the report.

Among types of coffee, the increase was most pronounced in gourmet varieties. About 24 percent of survey participants said they drank an espresso-based drink the day prior. The jump from 18 percent in 2016 was the biggest for this category.

Ownership of single-cup brewers was also on the rise, increasing to 33 percent of respondents from 29 percent a year ago.

The association has been conducting the survey annually since 1950. The margin of error is around 1.7 percent.

For Trump, it was the lost art of the deal | Reuters

By James Oliphant | WASHINGTON
In the end, the Closer couldn’t close the deal.

For President Donald Trump, the collapse on Friday of his first legislative priority, a healthcare reform bill, was an embarrassing loss of face after he and his administration insisted up until the time of the vote by the U.S. House of Representatives that there was enough Republican support.

It brings into question the neophyte president’s ability to move big-ticket legislation through Congress. And for a celebrity businessman who brands himself a deal-maker and fixer, it casts doubt over his ability to deliver on his bold "drain-the-swamp" promises to shake up Washington.

The White House wants to advance, among other things, tax reform and a massive infrastructure package this year, but now it must address whether a change of approach is needed and whether congressional allies such as House Speaker Paul Ryan can be counted on to deliver.

"This is the most consequential day of Trump's presidency and it's not just a failure, it's a stunning failure,” Charlie Sykes, an influential Wisconsin Republican political commentator and frequent Trump critic, said on Twitter.

Trump appeared to chalk up the loss in part to his own inexperience after House leaders pulled their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare following defections by both moderate and far-right Republican members who were unmoved by Trump's ultimatum to vote for the plan or live with the current system.

“We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process,” Trump said after the bill was withdrawn, adding that he would move forward with other priorities.

It was yet another setback for an administration barely two months in office that has already seen its national security adviser resign, had its immigration restrictions struck down in courts, and faces a barrage of questions about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

Trump’s hallmark salesmanship seemed to abandon him this week. Although he furiously courted the hard-line conservatives opposed to the reform bill, they largely refused to yield, and in the process he alienated moderates who initially supported the bill.

The president then switched tactics and gave up trying to bring the conservative opponents into the fold, instead delivering an ultimatum that all Republicans needed to back the bill. That did not work either.

Trump also failed to persuade the American public that the bill was an improvement over the one it would have repealed and replaced: the Affordable Care Act - the signature domestic achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Polls showed the replacement bill to be deeply unpopular, and conservative Republicans complained that their offices were being deluged by calls from constituents opposing it.

“This demonstrates that campaigning and legislating are two different things,” said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Representative Joe Barton of Texas blamed the failure on Republicans who control the White House, Senate and the House still learning how to govern after eight years of Obama.

"Sometimes you’re playing fantasy football and sometimes you’re in the real game,” Barton told Reuters.

Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida called it “a big blow" for the Republican agenda.

Trump’s efforts to engage the bill’s opponents at times seemed to muddy the process further, as he largely cut Ryan out of negotiations. (Ryan didn't seem to mind, calling Trump a "great closer.")

But even as Trump offered concessions, conservatives did not budge and moderates were angered.

Stuart Diamond, a professor who teaches negotiation at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump’s strong-arm tactics backfired.

“Threats don't work in general,” he said. “They cause damage to relationships. They definitely don't work in a situation with a lot of different stakeholders, where the power is distributed.”

With healthcare bill dead, Republicans turn to taxes

By David Morgan | WASHINGTON
After failing to repeal Obamacare, Republicans in the U.S. Congress quickly pivoted on Friday to President Donald Trump's next priority: overhauling the federal tax code, but their plan has already split the business community.

Division among Republicans was the chief cause of the embarrassing setback on Obamacare, and similar fault lines have been evident for months in the Republicans' tax plan, mainly over an untested proposal to use the tax code to boost exports.

House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady conceded the demise of a Republican plan to roll back Obamacare could make the path to tax reform harder. "This made a big challenge more challenging. But it’s not insurmountable," he told Fox News after Ryan canceled a vote on an Obamacare rollback bill.

But Brady said he and House Speaker Paul Ryan are all-in on tax reform.

Brady said House Republicans plan to begin moving on tax reform this spring and to pass legislation before Congress's summer recess in late July.

"We’re going to work with the administration to get this done,” he said.

Trump has been unclear about his position on the most problematic feature of the House Republicans' tax "blueprint," a proposal known as the border adjustment tax that would cut taxes on exports and raise them on imports.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that tax reform in many ways is "a lot simpler" than healthcare reform.

"We're able to take the tax code and redesign things and I think there is very, very strong support," Mnuchin said at an event hosted by news website Axios.

Comprehensive tax reform is a policy goal so complex that it has defied successive Congresses and presidents since 1986 when it was last accomplished under former President Ronald Reagan.

The U.S. tax code is riddled with narrow subsidies and loopholes, many of them deeply embedded in the economy and defended by the interests they benefit, such as the mortgage interest deduction and the business interest deductibility.

Brady's panel has been working on a plan since mid-2016 that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, end taxing foreign profits for U.S.-based multinationals and cut other tax rates for businesses and investors.

The plan has divided businesses, prompting import-dependent industries to warn of higher prices for consumer goods from clothing and electronics to gasoline.

Brady has been adamant that border adjustment will be part of the House tax reform, saying earlier this week that the provision was "a given" for final legislation but would include a transition period for import-heavy industries.

Democratic opposition to U.S. high court nominee grows

Supreme Court nominee judge Neil Gorsuch testifies during the third day of his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2017.  REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst
A third of Democratic senators have so far announced they will vote against confirming U.S. President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, adding to a chorus of opposition from the left, but leaving questions over whether there will be a concerted effort to block a vote in the Senate.

To date, 16 of the 48 Democratic senators have publicly backed their leader, Chuck Schumer, who said on Thursday he opposes confirming appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch. Others have yet to announce their intentions.

Gorsuch is headed toward a Senate Judiciary Committee vote, likely on April 3, on his nomination to the high court after a marathon four-day confirmation hearing this week.

After that, it is not yet clear how much of a fight Democrats will put up when the nomination is due for a final vote in the 100-member Senate, where there are 52 Republicans.

The Democratic opposition to Gorsuch could prompt a showdown in the Senate and delay the judge's confirmation but ultimately the Republicans are likely to win that fight and avoid another setback in Congress for Trump who suffered a blow on Friday when lawmakers pulled a major healthcare bill.

Senate rules enable Democrats to insist on 60 votes to overcome a procedural move called a filibuster to allow a final up-or-down vote on confirming Gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime job on the nation's highest court. (GRAPHIC - Confirming Gorsuch: How it works tmsnrt.rs/2nANgEj)

But the Senate's Republican leadership could adopt a rule change allowing a vote that would only require a simple majority of the chamber. If eventually confirmed, Gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court.

For Democrats, putting up a fight would at least frustrate Trump and placate liberal activists sore about the Republican-led Senate’s refusal to vote on President Barack Obama’s nominee to the same open seat on the court last year.

If eventually confirmed, Gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court.

DEMOCRATS TARGETED

Conservative activists were targeting ten Democrats running for reelection in 2018 in states Trump won in the presidential election as possible "yes" votes for Gorsuch among Democrats.

Of that number, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin have already announced their opposition to the nomination. The other seven, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have yet to announce their plans.

Another Democratic senator under pressure from both sides on Gorsuch is Michael Bennet, who represents Gorsuch’s home state of Colorado. Bennet has yet to announce his position.

Republicans are also hopeful that some Democratic members of the judiciary committee, including Chris Coons of Delaware and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, might be wary of blocking a vote on the nominee. Their spokesmen did not respond to requests seeking comment.

Don Stewart, a spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it would be an "unprecedented, even nuclear step" to require a 60-vote threshold before the Senate can vote on the nominee.

"There has never, in the history of the Republic, ever been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee," he added.

The last attempt to filibuster a nominee was a Democratic bid to block a vote on Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2005. Democrats failed to gather enough support and the Senate voted 72-25 to proceed to an up-or-down vote. Alito was eventually confirmed by 58-42.

Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, said Democrats may be able to gather enough support to block a vote because so few of them are moderates from Republican-leaning states, meaning they may feel they have little to lose. If Trump’s popularity drops, that could embolden them further, she added.

Powerful Texas Republican sees tough road for 'bathroom bill'

By Jon Herskovitz | AUSTIN, Texas
The Republican speaker of the Texas House of Representatives said on Friday a bill to limit bathroom access for transgender people would face a tough time in the chamber, where there are worries of an economic hit to the state if it became law.

Speaker Joe Straus, who sets the Republican-dominated House's legislative agenda, stopped short of saying the measure was doomed. He made his remarks at a University of Texas forum in Austin.

"I don’t feel a great deal of fervor to promote that bill in the House," Straus said.

Analysts expect Straus to send Senate Bill 6 (SB 6) to a committee led by one of his political supporters, who will keep it tucked away. The measure would then die when the current session ends in late May.

"Straus is signaling very clearly that SB 6 is dead," said Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University in Houston.

Straus reiterated his opposition to the legislation, which was approved by the Republican-controlled state Senate this month on a mostly party-line vote.

The bill would require people to use restrooms in public schools and government-run buildings that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate rather than the gender with which they identify.

The speaker called it "manufactured and unnecessary."

The bill is one of several similar measures before various state legislatures this year on the issue.

A similar law enacted a year ago in North Carolina prompted the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Texas Association of Business, the state's largest employers' group, has said such a law there would cost the state billions of dollars in lost revenue a year.

The bill's main backer, Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, has said it would keep sexual predators out of bathrooms and changing rooms, and he has labeled as fiction reports that there would be economic effects on the state.

Straus' San Antonio district is planning to host the NCAA men's Final Four basketball championship next year. Economists forecast the region could lose more than $200 million in revenue if the legislation was passed and in response the NCAA were to relocate the championship.

Trump touts Charter hiring that was in works for two years | Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday touted Charter Communications Inc's decision to invest $25 billion in the United States and a plan the company announced before he was elected to hire 20,000 workers over four years.

At a White House event with the second-largest U.S. cable company's Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Trump praised Charter for planning to close its offshore call centers and move them to the United States.

Much of the announcement was not new. Charter said last May that it planned to add 20,000 jobs as part of its merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks. As early as June 2015, Rutledge said Charter would need an additional 20,000 employees after those deals.

On a number of occasions, Trump has touted job announcements at the White House that had been previously planned or announced

The company said more than a year ago in February 2016 that it planned to close foreign Time Warner Cable call centers and move the jobs to the United States.

On Friday, Trump said, "We're embracing a new economic model - the American Model. We’re going to massively eliminate job-killing regulations - that has started already, big league - reduce government burdens, and lower taxes that are crushing American businesses and American workers.

"You’re going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs, of companies, and everything coming back into our country."

Charter, which has 24 million residential and business customers in 41 states, said on Friday it had committed to Trump to hiring those workers within four years. It plans to invest $25 billion in broadband infrastructure and technology in the next four years.

In May 2016 Rutledge said in a recorded interview there would be some overlap in management positions (after the TWC merger) but said the company would hire about 20,000 people over four years.

Rutledge said the broadband investment was being made "in the right regulatory climate and right tax climate ... We’re committed to spending that predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country."

Charter agreed in May 2016 to make significant broadband investment under a deal with the Federal Communications Commission that was part of winning approval to acquire the cable networks. At that time Charter agreed to extend high-speed internet access to another two million customers within five years, with one million served by a broadband competitor.

Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement on Friday that the commission was "working to set rules of the road that encourage companies to build and upgrade broadband networks across the country." He credited the FCC's "investment-friendly policies" in part for Charter's commitments.

The agency is considering a petition by the American Cable Association to strike the requirement Charter extend service to areas already served by companies because it could harm smaller competitors.

Charter also touted its plans to open a new bilingual call center in McAllen, Texas and said it expects to employ 600 there by the end of 2018. Plans to open a call center in Texas were announced last October.

In December, Trump announced that telecommunications group Sprint Corp and U.S. satellite company OneWeb would bring 8,000 jobs to the United States, and the companies said the positions were part of a previously disclosed pledge by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.

In January, Sprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said of its decision to shift 5,000 call center jobs to the United States that the company "had plans to do this for a while."

Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Friday:

HEALTHCARE

Trump suffers a stunning political setback in a Congress controlled by his own party when Republican leaders pull legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies.

Trump says the healthcare legislation he supported had been "very, very close" to getting enough support in the House of Representatives and that now he probably will move on to tax reform.

Wall Street's predilection for a glass-half-full view of Trump is on full display as investors back off fears that a failure to repeal Obamacare would endanger his entire agenda in favor of optimism that he will simply get on with tax cuts and infrastructure spending.

Nearly half of American adults say the Republican healthcare reform measure that was pulled from consideration by the House is "not an improvement" over Obamacare, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.

SURVEILLANCE

The partisan divide over the House Intelligence Committee's probe of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election deepens when the committee's top Democrat suggested its Republican chairman canceled a public hearing after pressure from the White House.

SUPREME COURT

A third of Democratic senators have so far announced they will vote against confirming Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, adding to a chorus of opposition from the left, but leaving questions over whether there will be a concerted effort to block a vote in the Senate.

PIPELINE

Trump's administration approves TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL pipeline, cheering the oil industry and angering environmentalists even as further hurdles for the controversial project loom.

ECONOMY

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says financial markets could improve "significantly" once they fully reflect the potential for economic growth from Trump's policies.

TRAVEL BAN

A federal judge in Virginia rules that Trump's travel ban was justified, increasing the likelihood the measure will go before the Supreme Court as the decision takes an opposing view to courts in Maryland and Hawaii that have halted the order.

CALIFORNIA CARS

California approves vehicle pollution targets that the Trump administration last week put on hold, setting up a potential face-off between federal and state regulators that could be expensive for automakers and a headache for consumers.

JOBS

Illinois governor vetoes Chicago pension fix, angers city's mayor

Bruce Rauner smiles after winning the midterm elections in Chicago, Illinois, November 4, 2014.  REUTERS/Jim Young
Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday vetoed a legislative fix favored by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel for two of the city’s struggling pension funds and castigated it as a “kick-the-can approach.”

The financial footing and credit ratings for the nation’s third-largest city have slipped precipitously as its unfunded pension liabilities grew to $33.8 billion for Chicago’s four retirement systems in the most recent accounting.

The plan that passed the Illinois Senate unanimously in January and cleared the House overwhelmingly last December would have granted the state’s blessing to alter the city’s pension repayment schedule for its municipal and laborers' retirement systems.

The systems are projected to run out of money in the coming decade and were depending on legislative sign-off of the city’s enactment of a water and sewer usage tax and telephone surcharge designed to help get them 90 percent funded in 40 years.

City officials have acknowledged that more money will be needed starting in 2023 when payments will reach actuarially required levels.

But Rauner rejected the package, saying it created a payment schedule that eventually would necessitate a tax increase for Chicago. He said it needed to be part of a broader, statewide pension funding strategy to address Illinois’ $129.8 billion unfunded pension liability.

"This is another kick-the-can approach to pension funding that landed Chicago in fiscal crisis in the first place,” Rauner said in a prepared statement. “This bill will create an unsustainable funding schedule that will lead to tax increases without solving the real problem.”

A spokesman for the Democratic mayor slammed the Republican governor’s action as an “irresponsible and irrational decision.”

“Instead of helping secure the future of our taxpayers and middle-class retirees, the governor chose to hold them hostage – just as he has done to social service providers, schoolchildren and universities across the state,” Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins said in a statement, referring to Rauner’s inability to broker a state budget deal for 21 months.

Rauner’s action left Democrats with no ability to block his veto because the pension bailout passed in the previous session of the state General Assembly, which ended in mid-January, and the governor’s only options were to approve or reject the measure.

But the city is pinning its hopes on an identical piece of legislation that passed the newly seated state Senate in late January and is awaiting action in the House, Collins said.

Tillerson to visit Turkey as Raqqa operation heats up

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet with senior Turkish officials in Ankara next week, in talks that could be vital to an advancing U.S.-backed campaign to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islamic State, U.S. officials said on Friday.

Turkey has been pressing the United States to drop its military alliance with the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which it considers part of the Kurdistan Workers' Party that has been fighting an insurgency for three decades in Turkey.

But U.S. officials have long viewed Kurdish fighters as key to an approaching assault on Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto capital. It would work alongside Arab fighters in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

Instead, Turkey wants the United States to draw from Syrian Arab rebel groups backed by Ankara for the final assault on Raqqa, a predominantly Arab city, proposals that so far have failed to convince U.S. officials who are not certain that the Turkish-backed Arab force is large and well-trained enough.

"We first need to work out details with Turkey," one senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The decision sets President Donald Trump's wish for quick battlefield victories against the need to maintain the United States' longstanding strategic alliance with Turkey, a NATO ally which provides the United States access to a base critical for the air war in Syria.

The Raqqa campaign appears to be gathering steam as an overlapping U.S.-backed effort in Iraq is drawing closer to driving Islamic State from the city of Mosul.

French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that the battle for Raqqa would likely start "in the coming days."

The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia told Reuters last week that the assault would begin at the start of April, and that the YPG would be taking part.

Some U.S. officials think that timeline is too optimistic, noting that a major battle underway for Tabqa dam, about 25 miles (40 km) west of Raqqa, could take weeks to complete.

The Pentagon also has said the United States has not decided on the composition of an American-backed assault force in Raqqa.

The United States has about 1,000 troops in Syria at the moment, and the Raqqa campaign could involve hundreds more.

KURDISH CONUNDRUM

Senator John McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee's chairman, suggested to reporters earlier this week that it would be hard to convince Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan of the merits of backing Kurdish fighters, even if they are the most effective weapon against Islamic State.

"The conundrum is that if you don't use the Kurds, it will take a lot longer while (Islamic State is) sending streams of terrorists out of Raqqa," McCain said.

"But if you do, you have an enormous challenge as far as relations with Turkey is concerned," he added.

McCain said the relationship with Erdogan was particularly important and cited an April 16 referendum on constitutional changes to extend his powers.

SAFE ZONES

Tillerson's meeting in Ankara also closely follows a meeting of 68 coalition partners this week in Washington, where they agreed to intensify the fight against Islamic State, including in Syria.

At Wednesday's meeting, Tillerson said the United States would create "interim zones of stability" through ceasefires to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against Islamic State and al Qaeda in Syria and Iraq.

He did not elaborate, although one U.S. official said there was not yet agreement among all American agencies on where and how such zones would be set up.

The U.S. military has long been skeptical of creating safe zones inside Syria or Iraq, partly because any safe zone guaranteed by the United States almost certainly would require some American military protection. Securing the ground alone would require thousands of troops, former U.S. officials and experts say.

The top U.S. commander on the ground, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, said earlier in March that, "We are building safe zones right now for all Iraqis and all Syrians to be safe from (Islamic State)."

Increased U.S. or allied air power would be required if Trump chooses to enforce "no fly" restrictions and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas.

The State Department did not provide more details of Tillerson's trip to Turkey, but said he will visit Brussels on March 31 to participate in a rescheduled meeting of NATO foreign ministers.

The NATO meeting had been set for April 5-6, but it was rescheduled after Tillerson decided instead to attend a summit with China. That caused unease among European allies already worried about Trump's commitment to the Western military alliance.

Nebraska May Stanch One Town’s Flow of Beer to Its Vulnerable Neighbors.
This town is a rural skid row, with only a dozen residents, a street strewn with debris, four ramshackle liquor stores and little else. It seems to exist only to sell beer to people like Tyrell Ringing Shield, a grandmother with silver streaks in her hair.

On a recent morning, she had hitched a ride from her home in South Dakota, just steps across the state line. There, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, alcohol is forbidden. In Whiteclay, though, it reigns supreme.

“You visit, you talk, you laugh, you drink,” said Ms. Ringing Shield, 57, as she stood on the sidewalk with friends, chain-smoked Montclair cigarettes and recounted her struggles with alcoholism, diabetes and cirrhosis. “It makes you forget.”

Now many residents of Nebraska and South Dakota are pushing for the liquor stores of Whiteclay to be shut, disgusted by the easy access to alcohol the stores provide to a people who have fought addiction for generations. The Nebraska authorities, in turn, have tightened scrutiny of the stores, which sell millions of cans of beer and malt liquor annually. Last year, for the first time, the state liquor commission ordered the stores’ six owners to reapply for their liquor licenses.

Continue reading the main story
The fate of the stores could be decided next month, when the three-member commission holds hearings in Lincoln, the state capital.

The issue has left people in South Dakota and Nebraska deeply divided. Most agree that alcohol abuse on the reservation is an entrenched problem, but they are unsure of the solution — and who is responsible.

The grim scene in Whiteclay has scarcely changed for decades. Particularly in the warmer months, Native Americans can be seen openly drinking beer in town, often passed out on the ground, disheveled and ill. Many who come to Whiteclay from the reservation spend the night sleeping on mattresses in vacant lots or fields.

Even under the chill of winter, people huddle outside the liquor stores, silver beer cans poking from coat pockets. The street, busy with traffic from customers, is littered with empty bottles and scraps of discarded clothing.

“It promotes so much misery, that little town,” said Andrea Two Bulls, 56, a Native American on Pine Ridge, who added that she hoped the state would revoke the licenses. “My brother used to go to Whiteclay all the time, and we’d have to go look for him. People sit and drink until they pass out. They just succumb.”

Over the decades, there have been frequent protests outside the stores. Lawsuits against the retailers and beer distributors have been filed. Boycotts of brewers that sell to the stores have begun with enthusiasm. All those efforts have sputtered, though, and little has changed.

But the last year has brought a powerful surge of action from advocates, legislators and even the state attorney general that seems to have imperiled the stores for the first time in memory.

This month, Doug Peterson, the Nebraska attorney general, said his office had evidence that the stores had been selling beer after hours and to bootleggers, a violation of state law that could further threaten the stores’ existence.

Though alcohol is illegal on the reservation, it is widely known that beer is easily purchased there — at two or three times the retail price — from the bootleggers who buy it off the reservation.

The Liquor Control Commission has questioned whether Whiteclay’s county, Sheridan, has enough law enforcement to serve the town. If the board decides it does not, that could be sufficient cause to revoke the stores’ licenses, which are set to expire in May.

Native Americans and many Nebraskans have long argued that while the stores may operate legally, they are an eyesore and an embarrassment.

“They’re basically bypassing the laws that alcohol is illegal on the reservation,” said Rosie Freier, the owner of a shop on Pine Ridge that sells Native art and jewelry. “The community of Whiteclay only exists because of the liquor stores, and there is very little law enforcement.”

Racquel Little Thunder, 33, who had stopped in the store to buy clothing, said she blamed the government of Nebraska, which reaps tax revenue from the stores.

“They just see dollars. They don’t care who buys liquor,” she said. “If they had any kind of heart, they wouldn’t sell alcohol so close to the reservation.”

Others argue that the problem of alcohol abuse on the reservation goes well beyond the stores in Whiteclay. Even some Native Americans said they were uneasy over upsetting the status quo.

“If we would get rid of the stores, there would be an uproar,” said Allyssa Comer, 20.

Vance Blacksmith, 47, a Native American and teacher on the reservation, said he favored leaving the stores alone. “They’re not hurting anyone,” he said. “Drinking is a personal choice. The people who drink are trying to accept life as it is. And it’s depressing, being here on Pine Ridge.”

Pine Ridge, one of the nation’s largest Indian reservations, is a catalog of social ills: Unemployment exceeds 80 percent, poverty affects more than 90 percent of those living on the reservation and alcoholism is rampant. By some estimates, one quarter of children born on the reservation have fetal alcohol syndrome.

Whiteclay is often seen as another somewhat hopeless and entrenched problem. State Senator Patty Pansing Brooks, who has represented Lincoln since 2015, said that when she began trying to whip up support in the Legislature to take action in Whiteclay, she heard a common response: Don’t bother. “Oh, we’ve looked at this before, there’s nothing you can do,” Ms. Pansing Brooks said she was told. When she went to Sheridan County last year, she said, she heard from residents, “What’s this white woman from Lincoln doing, putting her nose into our business?”

She saw it differently. “We have people lying on the streets, and it would not be allowed in any other part of the state,” she said. “We are selling alcohol to a people who we have known for centuries are particularly vulnerable to alcoholism. We have been living off and getting tax receipts from their hopeless, vulnerable situation.”

State Senator Tom Brewer, who is Native American and grew up near Whiteclay, has come out strongly against the stores.

“If you’re doing something that is so caustic and so wrong, to poison an entire group of people, you have to step back and say, ‘Is this something that we should be allowing, and not do something?’” he said. “No one before has had a burning passion to see it changed.”

Andrew Snyder, a lawyer representing the store owners, blamed political pressure for the scrutiny of the stores.

“What this is is our state government overstepping its bounds because of the political winds,” he said. “They’re getting harassed by the state on all sides.”

If the liquor licenses are revoked, the store owners will appeal, Mr. Snyder said.

Terry Robbins, the sheriff of Sheridan County, has found himself at the center of the fight over Whiteclay. He was in his office in Rushville early on a recent morning, a black cowboy hat overturned on his desk.

He bemoaned all the attention on Whiteclay from protesters, people he described as outsiders who should find something in their own communities to get angry about. He knows they are preparing to make even more of a public fuss when they go to Lincoln in April to attend hearings at the Capitol.

“We get people who say we wouldn’t have any more alcohol syndrome babies in the world if we just closed the liquor stores in Whiteclay,” he said. “Closing the beer stores in Whiteclay ain’t going to solve that problem.”

Sheriff Robbins echoed a common sentiment heard from both Nebraskans and Native Americans: If the stores lose their licenses and close down, people in search of beer will just drive farther to get it, endangering themselves and others on the roads. He favors containing the problem in Whiteclay, rather than allowing it to spread out over the county’s nearly 2,500 square miles.

“The people that want to drink are going to drive and get alcohol somewhere,” he said. “What I’m thinking is that it’s going to put more drunk drivers on the country roads.”

A more distant possibility is a buyout. Bruce and Marsha BonFleur, who run a ministry in Whiteclay, said they had been trying to raise money — at least $6 million — so that the store owners would sel As a Georgetown employee, Jeremy Alexander watched as the university grappled with its haunted past: the sale of slaves in 1838 to help rescue it from financial ruin.

He listened as Georgetown’s president apologized for its sins and looked for ways to make amends. And Mr. Alexander observed, with wonder, some of the slave descendants when they visited the campus.

What he did not know at the time: He was one of them.

Mr. Alexander’s paternal great-great-great grandmother, Anna Mahoney Jones, was one of the 272 slaves sold by two Jesuit priests at Georgetown for about $115,000, or $3.3 million in today’s dollars. She and her two young children were enslaved at a plantation in Ascension Parish, La.

“Now I work here — to realize that this is my history, this is my story, blows me away,” said Mr. Alexander, 45, an executive assistant in Georgetown’s office of technology commercialization. “I have been really emotional as I learned about my ties to the university.”

Continue reading the main story
The journey began with Mr. Alexander’s own digging to find out more about his lineage, to find out more about the ties that bind. He wanted to know more not just for himself, but for his 9-year-old son.

Mr. Alexander had his DNA tested in 2014, along with that of his wife and parents, and worked on a family tree on an ancestry website. But that search ended at the name of his great-grandmother, Anna Jones — the granddaughter of Anna Mahoney Jones. But for Mr. Alexander, it was just a name, no story attached.

The path backward might have stopped there, if not for an unexpected email. Last fall, Mr. Alexander heard from a woman in Boston, Melissa Kemp, who turned out to be a distant cousin. They had a conversation on the day before Thanksgiving, each recounting the century-old names of relatives they shared, including Anna Jones.

Ms. Kemp went back two more generations and introduced Mr. Alexander to the name that would come to define his earliest known roots and reveal his connection to Georgetown: Anna Mahoney Jones.

She told him that Mrs. Mahoney Jones was among the slaves sold to help Georgetown survive, making Mr. Alexander a part of the Catholic institution’s own history. He told her those connections were even closer — because he worked at the university.

Judy Riffel, a genealogist, confirmed through archival records and DNA test results that Mr. Alexander was a descendant of Mrs. Mahoney Jones.

On discovering his roots, Mr. Alexander said he was not bitter or angry because “it was the way the United States operated at the time.” He added that he was proud that the university “has worked to right the wrong.”

In 2015, an alumnus of the university, Richard J. Cellini, organized a nonprofit, the Georgetown Memory Project, to trace the 272 men, women and children and their descendants.l and close down for good. The BonFleurs have held meetings with the owners, who Mr. BonFleur said were exhausted from the attention and open to the idea of selling.

“We believe that they want to do the right thing,” he said, sitting in the living room of the couple’s wood-paneled cabin, a short walk from the stores. “They’re ready to get out.”

Georgetown Employee Learns University Sold His Ancestor. As part of a series of reconciliation steps, Georgetown’s president, John J. DeGioia, announced the next year that the university would award preferential status in the admission process to descendants of the enslaved.

Next month, the university will hold a religious ceremony to honor the slaves and their descendants, and apologize for its role in slavery.

Genealogists have continued to comb through records in courthouses and archives for the slightest clues about the group, from their lives on the Jesuit plantations in Maryland to the Louisiana plantations and beyond.

They have learned that Mrs. Mahoney Jones was born in 1811 and married Arnold Jones in the mid-1820s. Jesuit records show Mr. Jones escaped before the slaves were sold. She is listed on the Katharine Jackson ship manifest as Ann Jones (both name spelling and age vary by document) along with their children, Arnold, 9, and Louisa, 6. Mrs. Mahoney Jones and her children were enslaved at the Chatham Plantation about 10 miles north of Donaldsonville, La., on the west bank of the Mississippi River.

Her name shows up again in the 1870 census as living in New Orleans, where she died four years later.

“This was not about counting names, but of trying to learn the stories of their lives,” said Ms. Riffel, who is working on the Memory Project. “It is so meaningful to be able to make these connections and find families in the face of slavery, which makes it very difficult.”

So far, about 4,000 of the descendants, living and dead, have been identified. Among the contemporaries: a retired nurse in Charlotte, N.C., and a retired television news anchor in Baton Rouge, La.

And now: Mr. Alexander, a Chicago native and Georgetown employee for three years. (He previously worked there for a short stint in 2005.) He lives in Fulton, Md., with his wife and son. And he is Catholic, like the generations before him.

He still remembers making the long drive from Chicago to Pass Christian, Miss., each summer to spend time with his paternal family. Generations of Alexanders still live there. His father, Arnold Simeon Alexander, one of 11 children, was an Army veteran who fought in World War II and died in 2014.

“The most difficult part of this is that I cannot tell my dad,” Mr. Alexander said.
Arkansas Struggles to Find Enough People to Watch Executions
The state of Arkansas, which plans to execute eight inmates over 10 days next month, is struggling to overcome a logistical problem to carry that out: There are not enough people who want to watch them die.

A state law requires that at least six people witness an execution to ensure that the state’s death penalty laws are properly followed. But so far, finding that many volunteer witnesses to cover all of the scheduled executions has proved difficult, prompting the director at the Department of Correction to take the extraordinary step of personally seeking volunteers.

A department spokesman declined to say whom the director, Wendy Kelley, has approached for help, but she has extended invitations at least to members of the Little Rock Rotary Club, according to news reports. Ms. Kelley made the request, which the members initially thought was a joke, after delivering a keynote address on Tuesday.

“You seem to be a group that does not have felony backgrounds and are over 21,” Ms. Kelley told the Rotarians, according to The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. “So if you’re interested in serving in that area, in this serious role, just call my office.”

Bill Booker, a Rotary Club member, said some people in the audience initially laughed at Ms. Kelley’s remarks. “It quickly became obvious that she was not kidding,” he told KARK-TV, an NBC affiliate in Little Rock. The spokesman for the Department of Correction, Solomon Graves, declined to describe the response Ms. Kelley had received to her requests. “We continue to be confident in our ability to carry out these sentences on the dates set by the governor,” Mr. Graves wrote in a text message on Friday.

Under Arkansas state law, execution witnesses must be at least 21 years old and a resident of the state, cannot have a felony conviction and cannot be related to the death row inmate or a victim in the case.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson last month scheduled the executions of eight men — four black and four white, and all convicted of murder — from April 17 to 27. Two men will be executed on each of four execution dates.

The Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington-based group that provides analysis and information on issues concerning capital punishment, says on its website that no other state has conducted as many as eight executions in a month since capital punishment resumed in the United States in 1977.

The dates were placed so closely together because of another logistical issue: Arkansas’s supply of midazolam, a sedative used in a three-drug injection method, has an expiration date at the end of April.

Capital punishment has been suspended in Arkansas since 2005 because of legal challenges and the difficulty in acquiring lethal-injection drugs. The state tried to restart its capital punishment system in 2015 and set dates for that year, but appeals forced the postponement of the executions.

The state law requires six to 12 “respectable citizens” to be present, and Ms. Kelley told the Rotary Club that the state had also struggled in 2015 to find enough witnesses for the executions before they were suspended.

President James K. Polk’s Body May Be Moved. NASHVILLE — It is the latest chapter in one of the more tangled stories of an American presidential corpse — a tale of love and cholera, betrayal and real estate, honor and probate law.

But having been interred in three different places since his death in 1849, James K. Polk, the 11th president of the United States, now faces the prospect of having his sleep disturbed yet again.

A new proposal making its way through the Tennessee legislature calls for digging up the bodies of Polk and his wife, Sarah Childress Polk, both of which have been buried on the grounds of the state Capitol for more than a century. They would then be relocated to a final resting place at a Polk family home and museum in the small city of Columbia.

Supporters say the move will properly honor an unjustly overlooked president, a man who expanded the territory of the United States by a third, signed a law establishing the Smithsonian Institution and created the Naval Academy.

Opponents, including Teresa Elam, 65, a distant relative of Polk’s, are calling it nothing short of macabre, and an unsavory effort to promote tourism in Columbia, a city of 37,000 about 50 miles south of Nashville that is otherwise known for a colorful yearly celebration of its mule-breeding industry.

“They’re desecrating a grave,” said Ms. Elam, who has walked the halls of the Capitol with a sheaf full of historical documents, making her case to lawmakers. “It’s been on the Capitol grounds for about 124 years. It’s dishonor and disrespect.” The relocation of a president’s body after death is not unheard-of. In 1858, the remains of James Monroe, the fifth president, were moved from New York to his native Virginia, at a time of rising sectional tension. And the coffin of President Abraham Lincoln has been moved around his burial spot in Springfield, Ill., at least 17 times, by one count, including a bizarre thwarted effort in 1876 to steal his body and hold it for ransom.

In Nashville, the prospect that the presidential remains could be moved yet again has prompted rare fits of passion on the topic of Polk, a man historians have called “priggish” and “colorless,” and one whose legacy is often overshadowed by his larger-than-life mentor, Andrew Jackson, who is buried at the Hermitage, his family plantation, a major tourist draw here.

Indeed, when President Trump, who often likens himself to Jackson, visited Nashville this month, he laid a wreath on Mr. Jackson’s tomb, honoring him in a speech as a president who “understood that real leadership means putting America first.” If Mr. Trump knew where Polk’s tomb was, he did not let on.

On Monday, the State Senate is expected to vote on a resolution that would be the first step in an approval process for relocating the bodies. Disinterring the remains will also require the approval of the state House of Representatives, the governor, the Tennessee Historical Commission and a local judge.

The Polks’ grave, which is currently tucked away on a grassy patch, was designed by William Strickland, the noted Greek Revival architect who designed the state Capitol and George Washington’s sarcophagus at Mount Vernon in Virginia. A handsome cenotaph framed by classical columns notes that Polk “planted the laws of the American union on the shores of the Pacific.” The grave is dwarfed by a nearby equestrian statue of Mr. Jackson.

State Senator Joey Hensley, a Republican representing Columbia and the sponsor of the bill, said the grave seems overlooked in its current spot. “I honestly served up here 14 years and had never seen the site,” he said on Thursday. “It’s not handicap accessible. It’s not really talked about much when they do the Capitol tour. Not many people visit it. It’s just not a very good place to honor his legacy.” Much drama preceded the grave’s ultimate location. Polk had numerous ailments. An operation for urinary stones as a teenager is likely to have left him sterile or impotent, and may explain why he did not have children, according to John Seigenthaler, one of his biographers.

Polk left the White House in 1849 after serving just one term, as he had promised, and returned that April to Nashville, where he had previously served a two-year term as governor. But the city was in the midst of a cholera outbreak, and Polk contracted the disease and died in June at age 53.

Tom Price, the curator of the President James K. Polk Home and Museum in Columbia, said that by city ordinance, cholera victims at the time had to be buried at the municipal cemetery on the edge of town. By May 1850, however, Polk was moved, with much pomp and ceremony, to Polk Place, a grand home a few blocks from the Capitol that he had bought in 1847, anticipating a long retirement. His wife, a formidable woman who did much to shape his career, remained in Polk Place, celebrated as one of the nation’s most famous widows, until her death in 1891. Then things got complicated.

In a will he drew up five months before his death, Polk, a lawyer, stipulated that both his body and that of his wife should be buried on the premises of Polk Place. He also stipulated that after his death and his wife’s, the property should be held in trust by the state, which must always allow a blood relative to live there.

Upon the death of Polk’s wife, a number of heirs filed a lawsuit arguing that the will was invalid. According to Bill Carey, a local researcher and writer, the court ruled in their favor, on the grounds that the will violated the common-law rule against perpetuities, which limits an owner’s ability to leave property to unborn future generations. Polk Place was sold, and the manse torn down; today, there is a boutique hotel on the property. On Sept. 19, 1893, Polk’s body was moved to the Capitol, where he was buried alongside his wife. “In my mind,” Mr. Carey wrote in 2015, “the reinterment of President and Mrs. Polk is one of the most disrespectful deeds ever committed by the state of Tennessee.”

Critics of the new plan include Carroll Van West, the state historian. “When Polk left the White House he came home to Nashville, and his wife stayed there for decades afterward,” Mr. Van West told The Nashville Scene this week.

Other family members appear split on the issue. In Columbia this week, supporters of the idea seemed mildly astonished that they had caused such an uproar.

On Wednesday, Mr. Price, the curator of Polk House, gave a tour of the state-owned historical property. It was late afternoon and there were no other visitors in sight.

The handsome Federal-style home was built by Polk’s father in 1816. Polk lived in it as a young man from 1818 to 1824. Today it is furnished with much of the furniture from Polk Place. A gift shop sells jars of Polk Pickles and bottles of President’s Choice wine.

Mr. Price acknowledged that it was difficult to get students, even from schools around Columbia, to tour the home because Mr. Jackson’s famous Hermitage is so close by. But he insisted that the proposal to move Polk’s body was not about tourism, as much as it was about honoring a president’s wishes.

“He wanted to be buried at home,” he said, and this was as close as Polk could get.
An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”

For each of Texas A&M’s 64,000 students, otherwise known as Aggies, those words are intended as a creed. The Aggie Code of Honor is drilled into freshmen at a required orientation session. It appears at the end of all written exams, followed by a space for students to sign their assent. A marble monument to the code graces the campus here.

Violating the code is serious business. But even by the standards of a university that takes itself and its place in Texas lore seriously, the current campus uproar over the code, which began with a dispute over who won an election for student body president, has heads spinning.

Rick Perry — the United States energy secretary, former Texas governor, two-time presidential candidate and A&M alumnus (class of 1972) — in an op-ed published in The Houston Chronicle on Wednesday accused the university’s Student Government Association of rigging the election to favor an openly gay candidate, Bobby Brooks.

Mr. Brooks described the past few days as an “ordeal.” He said he first learned of Mr. Perry’s op-ed on Wednesday evening, when he was contacted by a Houston Chronicle reporter.

Rick Perry Calls Election a ‘Mockery.’ It’s Not What You’re Thinking. MARCH 23, 2017

Senate Confirms Rick Perry as Energy Secretary MARCH 2, 2017
“I was very curious as to why Rick Perry would have devoted his time to this,” Mr. Brooks recalled in an interview on Friday. “And also why he would use my full name in the story.”

Mr. Brooks says that since the election he has faced harassment from members of opposing campaigns. On March 17, he said, he was accosted at a convenience store in Longview, Tex., by supporters of a rival candidate, whom he declined to identify. He said he was physically threatened and had to leave the store. A friend, Laura Haslam, an A&M junior who remained inside, verified his account and said the young men, whom she did not know, used homophobic slurs after Mr. Brooks left.

The first-place finisher, Robert McIntosh, went to court on Friday to fight his disqualification, which came after he was found to have failed to document a campaign expense: glow sticks that appeared in a campaign video. He filed a petition in United States District Court in Brazos County requesting permission to take depositions from three student government officers he claims conspired to rob him of victory.

The petition alleges that Mr. McIntosh was disqualified “based on the fact that he is a heterosexual, white, Christian male.” In a news release, Mr. McIntosh’s lawyer accused the student government association of depriving him of “the free exercise of his religion.”

To understand how a student election could get so heated, it helps to understand the fierce loyalty A&M inspires.

“We have this saying that from the outside looking in, you can’t understand it, and from the inside looking out, you can’t explain it,” said Sam King, editor in chief of the university newspaper, The Battalion.

Recent decades have brought major changes to A&M, which was created by the Texas Legislature in 1871 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas.

In 1994, the first woman was elected class president. In 2008, the university’s GLBT Resource Center opened. The university has tried to recruit more minority students and now has a vice president for diversity. The election of an openly gay student body president was initially hailed as another milestone. Now there are questions about why Mr. Brooks’s opponent was disqualified.

The election was held Feb. 23-24. Mr. Brooks was declared the winner on Feb. 25, after Mr. McIntosh was disqualified by the student-run Judicial Court. Mr. McIntosh’s appeal was rejected on March 9.

It remained a dispute on campus. And then Mr. Perry chimed in.

“Brooks’s presidency is being treated as a victory for ‘diversity,’” Mr. Perry wrote in his op-ed. “It is difficult to escape the perception that this quest for ‘diversity’ is the real reason the election outcome was overturned. Does the principle of ‘diversity’ override and supersede all other values of our Aggie Honor Code?” The election of an openly gay student body president was initially hailed as another milestone.

“Brooks’s presidency is being treated as a victory for ‘diversity,’” Mr. Perry wrote in his op-ed. “It is difficult to escape the perception that this quest for ‘diversity’ is the real reason the election outcome was overturned. Does the principle of ‘diversity’ override and supersede all other values of our Aggie Honor Code?”The majestic beauty of California’s Sierra Nevada never fails to impress. But the mountain range, which stretches hundreds of miles, is much more than a stunning vista. It’s a linchpin that helps make living in an arid state possible.

That’s because one of California’s most important water supplies is melted snow. Each spring and summer, the Sierra sends runoff down its slopes that recharges rivers and reservoirs, allowing crops to be irrigated and drinking glasses to be filled.

Knowing with precision how much snow has accumulated is crucial for farmers and water managers.

That’s where a mapping project at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory known as the Airborne Snow Observatory comes in. Using measurements gathered by specialized instruments on a plane, scientists have been able to gain an unprecedented understanding of the amount of water present in the Sierra’s snow.

This year, after California’s very wet winter, the totals have been remarkably big.

Using the NASA data, we compared this year's snowpack with that of 2015, when the state was in the grip of drought (which, at least officially, is still ongoing). In the interactive maps below, the white areas had a meter, or 3.3 feet, or more of snow on the ground in March.

High in the mountains, this year's snow blankets the ground in layers tens of feet deep in many places. At the lower elevations around the Hetch Hetchy reservoir, which collects most of the melting snow runoff in this area and supplies water to millions, there was almost no snow to speak of in 2015. This year, the snowpack reached down to within a few hundred feet of the reservoir's edge: These maps show parts of the Tuolumne Basin, which in late February was blanketed by 1.2 million acre-feet of snow-water equivalent, or the amount of water that would result if the snow were instantly melted.

That's about 10 times the amount as the same time in 2015, said Thomas Painter, a snow hydrologist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology, who leads the NASA program.

He added, “And it keeps on coming.” The airborne observatory has been detecting snow depths in the mountains ranging from a few feet at lower elevations to more than 70 feet in avalanche areas.

“Some of the snowdrifts have faces of 25 to 40 feet,” said Jeffrey Payne, a water resources manager at the Friant Water Authority who has analyzed the NASA data. “So we’ve got some pretty serious snow.” The airborne observatory has been detecting snow depths in the mountains ranging from a few feet at lower elevations to more than 70 feet in avalanche areas.

“Some of the snowdrifts have faces of 25 to 40 feet,” said Jeffrey Payne, a water resources manager at the Friant Water Authority who has analyzed the NASA data. “So we’ve got some pretty serious snow.” The snow observatory project, which began flights over the Sierra in 2013, is a groundbreaking initiative in California, where aging infrastructure, a warming climate and rapid population growth have made water management a high-stakes job.

For decades, state officials have estimated snowpack levels by extrapolating from ground-based data gathered at points across the range.

The margin of error, unsurprisingly, has been huge.

“It’s like turning on your TV screen and four of the pixels turn on, and you can only use those four every single time you watch ‘Breaking Bad,’” Dr. Painter said.

Every one to four weeks, the NASA crew circles above the Sierra Nevada in an airplane that fires laser pulses toward the ground. By measuring how fast the pulses bounce back, the scientists are able to create detailed topographical maps.

Compare those with maps of the mountains when bare and factor in the snow’s density, and they can tell how much water is present.

With the view from the sky, Dr. Painter said, “we turn on the whole screen, every pixel.” The observatory also measures the reflection of sunlight off the snow, which is critical to understanding how much energy the snow absorbs and how fast it could melt.

Mr. Payne of the Friant Water Authority, which manages water for agricultural land in the San Joaquin Valley, said the new snow data was game-changing for farmers, who will be able to plan their crops with greater confidence.

“We need to be smarter about how we approach water resource management,” Mr. Payne said. “And this new technology is sort of a beacon of hope.”

For now, the observatory is taking measurements for most of the central Sierra Nevada. The hope is to get more buy-in from state officials and expand to the whole range, Dr. Painter said.

It has been an increasingly easy sell.

“It really has gotten to the point now where we don’t call on anyone,” Dr. Painter said. “We are simply responding to phone calls.”
A new approach by the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington to use social media to raise awareness about teenagers reported missing did indeed gain attention — some of it unintentional.

Starting in January, the department changed the way it alerted the public about missing teenagers by posting their photographs, names and ages on Twitter. Previously, publicity about each case was discretionary.

That change, though, prompted a burst of attention by activists, members of the public and politicians, who interpreted the postings as a spike in the number of missing teenagers, particularly blacks and Hispanics.

Local news media reported on the missing. Online, their photographs were widely shared, urging the authorities to take action. “Does anyone care?” one website asked.In a letter on Tuesday, the Congressional Black Caucus called on the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to determine whether the disappearances were an anomaly or part of a larger trend.

“Ten children of color went missing in our nation’s capital in a period of two weeks, and, at first, garnered very little media attention,” the caucus wrote, calling it “deeply disturbing” and indicative of an assumption that those children had all run away and had not been abducted.

The police responded with statements, held a news conference this month and responded to people on Twitter. The posts on Twitter did not mean more people were going missing, said Margarita Mikhaylova, a spokeswoman.
The department reported that since the beginning of this year, 501 teenagers, who appear to be mostly black and Hispanic, had gone missing in Washington. Twenty-two of those cases and five others from 2014 and 2016 remained open on Tuesday.

Cmdr. Chanel Dickerson, who leads the department’s Youth and Family Services Division, spoke in a Facebook Live presentation on Friday about the reports of missing children. The campaign “increased public awareness,” she said. “That’s all.”

Ms. Mikhaylova said, “They leave voluntarily, they come back voluntarily or they are located.”

“Some of the circumstances that would lead an individual to leave home, that is a very complex issue,” she said. “They need to be talked about in the community with as much gravity as anything,” She added that human trafficking was a concern nationwide, but that “we don’t have an indication that that is what is going on.”

There are no reports that any of the missing teenagers were abducted, Ms. Mikhaylova said.

Also on Friday, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a series of measures to improve the city’s response to reports of missing children and address issues that lead young people to run away from home.

The figures that the police department reported on missing juveniles in the first quarter of 2017 are on track to equal or be lower than the totals in previous years. At the end of 2016, for example, there were 2,242 missing juveniles (aged 17 and younger) reported.

Robert Lowery Jr., the vice president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said that the department figures were “about average” and that the center was not seeing an increase in reports of missing teenagers and children nationwide.

“But one missing child is too many,” he said. “We all agree on that.” California Upholds Auto Emissions Standards.
California’s clean-air agency voted on Friday to push ahead with stricter emissions standards for cars and trucks, setting up a potential legal battle with the Trump administration over the state’s plan to reduce planet-warming gases.

The vote, by the California Air Resources Board, is the boldest indication yet of California’s plan to stand up to President Trump’s agenda. Leading politicians in the state, from the governor down to many mayors, have promised to lead the resistance to Mr. Trump’s policies.

Mr. Trump, backing industry over environmental concerns, said easing emissions rules would help stimulate auto manufacturing. He vowed last week to loosen the regulations. Automakers are aggressively pursuing those changes after years of supporting stricter standards.

But California can write its own standards because of a longstanding waiver granted under the Clean Air Act, giving the state — the country’s biggest auto market — major sway over the auto industry. Twelve other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, as well as Washington, D.C., follow California’s standards, a coalition that covers more than 130 million residents and more than a third of the vehicle market in the United States.

“All of the evidence — call it science, call it economics — shows that if anything, these standards should be even more aggressive,” said the board member Daniel Sperling, a transportation expert at the University of California, Davis.

The board’s chairwoman, Mary D. Nichols, an assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, was even more pointed, admonishing automakers for milking Mr. Trump for favors.

“What were you thinking when you threw yourselves upon the mercy of the Trump administration to try to solve your problems?” she asked. “Let’s take action today, and let’s move on.”

Long a forerunner in environmental regulation, California worked with the Obama administration on joint standards that became a crucial part of the country’s effort to combat climate change. Officials said the regulations would reduce the country’s oil consumption by 12 billion barrels and eliminate six billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution over the lifetime of the cars affected. That amounts to more than a year’s worth of America’s carbon emissions.

Adopted in 2012, the standards would require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025, to 54.5 miles per gallon, forcing automakers to speed development of highly fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrid and electric cars. Mr. Trump intends to lower that target.

Friday’s unanimous vote by the 14-member board, which affirmed the higher standards through 2025, amounted to a public rejection of Mr. Trump’s plans.

Now, the question is how — or whether — the Trump administration will handle California’s dissent. The administration could choose to revoke California’s waiver, at which point experts expect the state would sue.

California sued the George W. Bush administration after it challenged California’s waiver in 2007. Mr. Obama reversed the federal challenge.

The White House and the E.P.A., which have not yet determined their plans for the California waiver, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Several states that follow California’s rules raced to its defense. “We’ve come a long way together,” said Steven Flint, director of the air resources division of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. “We’re with you, and we believe in what you’re doing.”

Environmentalists and public health experts have criticized the automakers’ resistance to emissions rules under the Trump administration as an about-face. All major automakers previously voiced support for the more stringent standards. After the election of Mr. Trump, a group representing the nation’s biggest makers of cars and light trucks urged a reassessment of the emissions rules, which the group said posed a “substantial challenge” for the auto industry.

Automakers now complain about the steep technical challenge that the stringent standards pose. They have estimated that only about 3.5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it, and that their industry would have to spend a “staggering” $200 billion by 2025 to comply.

A separate study by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a think tank supporting emissions controls, has estimated that the cost of meeting those standards could be overstated by as much as 40 percent. And auto industry experts have warned that a slowdown in America’s shift toward efficient cars could leave its auto market a global laggard.

John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, an industry trade group, said before the California vote that companies agreed on the need to continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. But he urged California to fall into line with federal rules.

“There is a more effective way forward than regulatory systems that are different,” Mr. Bozzella said. He also suggested that demand for clean cars remained relatively tiny.

What was required, he said, were standards that “balance innovation, compliance and consumer needs and wants.”

Automakers have also been critical of a California’s zero-emission vehicle program, which requires automakers to sell a certain percentage of electric cars and trucks in California and nine other states. The board voted on Friday to continue that program.

Politicians in California, one of the country’s most Democratic states, have embraced acting as a bulwark against Mr. Trump’s policies, promising to defend the state’s laws on immigration, health care and the environment. Many cities in California have broad “sanctuary” policies aimed at protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants. State law also provides some protections for immigrants from being turned over to federal authorities for deportation.

In addition, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, declared that California would continue to work toward its legally required target of reducing carbon emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And the state has retained Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, to advise on potential legal fights with the White House.

Even at the federal level, the president’s announcement alone will not be enough to immediately roll back emissions standards, a process expected to take more than a year of legal and regulatory reviews by the E.P.A. and the Transportation Department. The Trump administration would then need to propose its own replacement fuel-economy standards.

Still, the Trump administration’s move to ease emissions rules is the first part of an expected assault on Mr. Obama’s environmental legacy. In the coming weeks, Mr. Trump is also expected to announce that he will direct the E.P.A. to dismantle Obama-era regulations on pollution from coal-fired power plants.

The E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said he does not think carbon dioxide is a primary cause of global warming, a statement at odds with the scientific consensus on climate change.

Bonnie Holmes-Gen of the American Lung Association of California, one of many health and environmental groups that spoke at the board meeting, said moving away from strict emissions standards would hurt public health and the health of the planet. She urged the state to stay its course.

“The public is bearing a huge cost — billions of dollars in health expenses and damage from climate,” Ms. Holmes-Gen said. “I urge California to keep us on track.”

President Trump’s failure to make good on his signature promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is the most crushing political defeat of his early days in the White House.

But it is hardly the only one.

Mr. Trump — who sold himself as a winner who could turn around a country that “doesn’t win anymore” — has endured a litany of missteps, controversies, resignations and investigations, all of which have dented his “I alone can fix it” vow to remake government with businesslike efficiency. Mr. Trump — who sold himself as a winner who could turn around a country that “doesn’t win anymore” — has endured a litany of missteps, controversies, resignations and investigations, all of which have dented his “I alone can fix it” vow to remake government with businesslike efficiency.

A month shy of the 100-day mark that presidents use to gauge success, Mr. Trump’s largely self-inflicted setbacks are evidence of a novice politician, often uninterested in the inner workings of government, who is struggling to wield his constitutional authority or fully understand the limits of his office.

“No administration has ever been off to a worse 100-day start,” said Steve Schmidt, a longtime Republican strategist who served as a counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney.

As Mr. Trump seeks to recover, the president’s difficulties in governing effectively — building coalitions, anticipating roadblocks, neutralizing opponents and seeing around the corner — pose a far greater threat to his coming initiatives on a tax code overhaul and infrastructure than any obstruction Democrats could come up with.

Mr. Schmidt said the White House would have to be “delusional” not to recognize the depths of the challenges for the new president. The question for Mr. Trump, he added, is: “Does he learn lessons about Washington deal-making from this debacle?”

The answer to that question is not yet clear.

Since Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump has fired his national security adviser for lying, watched as courts twice blocked his travel bans on some majority-Muslim countries and fumed as the F.B.I. announced that it was investigating his associates for any ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. On his watch, the military conducted a botched raid in Yemen — which he approved over dinner days into his presidency — and the United States military is investigating reports that perhaps as many as 200 civilians have been killed in recent airstrikes in Mosul, Iraq. Mexico’s president angrily canceled a White House visit amid a feud over Mr. Trump’s plan for a border wall. The president and his staff have uttered a long list of falsehoods, including an unfounded charge that President Barack Obama tapped his phones, that have entangled them in days of controversy.

Mr. Trump’s approval ratings — never high to begin with — have sagged to the high 30s, the lowest ever recorded at this point in a presidency.

White House officials say the president has had a number of successes, too. Sean Spicer, the press secretary, pointed to the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, the president’s well-received address to a joint session of Congress and the many executive orders the president has issued.

“How many people have done this much in 60 days?” Mr. Spicer said. “There’s a lot of points on the board.”

Still, the president’s allies acknowledge that he has been hampered by a lack of disciplined planning and effective execution, often because the administration is furiously reacting to outside events or to one of Mr. Trump’s own unexpected Twitter posts.

Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker and a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, said the Republicans’ decision to abandon the health care bill on Friday should persuade the president not to rely on Speaker Paul D. Ryan or other party allies to carry out his agenda.

“He cannot delegate. The world he wants is so dramatically different from anything that they’ve experienced.” Mr. Gingrich said.

He described Mr. Trump as “so angry” at Republican lawmakers for their failure on the health care bill. “He’s angry at the fact that they spent several weeks going down a dead end where he was assured they had the votes,” Mr. Gingrich said. During a meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday, Mr. Ryan told the president that he was sorry the votes were not there. Mr. Trump bluntly told Mr. Ryan that many people had said he should have gone against the speaker’s advice and pursued a tax code overhaul first, a refrain the president has returned to frequently.

But Mr. Gingrich rejected the idea that Mr. Trump’s presidency would be hobbled by the health care debacle or any of the other setbacks. He predicted that the president would win confirmation of Judge Gorsuch, and noted that even as the health care bill failed, Mr. Trump on Friday reversed Mr. Obama’s rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project that is popular among Mr. Trump’s supporters.

“He was the president this morning. He will be the president tomorrow. He has all the advantages that that implies,” Mr. Gingrich said. “He’s having a better presidency than anybody in the Washington media thinks.”

And Mr. Trump is not alone in making early missteps.

President Bill Clinton got embroiled in an early controversy over service by gays in the military. And the effort by his wife, Hillary Clinton, to overhaul health care failed just as spectacularly as Mr. Trump’s did. Mr. Obama lost his bid for “cap and trade” legislation limiting carbon emissions, though that defeat came during his second year in office.

Still, the challenge for Mr. Trump is clear: how to move past the daily turmoil and infighting inside the West Wing and prove that he can use his background as a businessman to advance the policies that he promised as a candidate.

To win an overhaul of the nation’s tax code and a $1 trillion investment in public infrastructure, Mr. Trump will need to find a way to build winning coalitions in the House and the Senate by corralling the often-warring factions in the Republican Party. That may be even more difficult on a tax overhaul than it was on health care, given the moneyed interests watching every proposed change. On some bipartisan goals, the president will have to seize the chance to pick up some Democratic votes as well.

To succeed in his use of executive power, the president will need to be more deft in drafting orders that will not be challenged in court. Mr. Obama faced similar problems as he increasingly used his executive authority to get around a recalcitrant Republican Congress.

To avoid being trapped in endless investigations, Mr. Trump will have to tone down his war of words with intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Investigations can drain the political life from a presidency, as Ronald Reagan found during the Iran-contra scandal and Mr. Clinton learned during the Monica Lewinsky investigations.

And if Mr. Trump wants to repair his personal credibility, which as been damaged in part by the many falsehoods he has articulated, he might have to curtail his use of Twitter.

In an interview with The New York Times as Republicans conceded failure on the health care bill, Mr. Trump insisted that the legislative process was not unlike what he faced in his career in real estate. But Friday evening, the president told his bleary-eyed aides that his old business was easy compared with what he had just encountered in Washington.

As Mr. Trump retired to the White House residence, he sounded tired in every way, including in spirit, his advisers said. There was a weariness about him that had not been present a day earlier.

In the end, the ragged start to Mr. Trump’s presidency may be the result of the way he views his relationship to Washington — as an outsider with little respect for the niceties expected by career politicians, the news media, diplomats, lobbyists and interest groups.

In his inaugural speech, the president condemned the establishment, calling it “a small group” that has “reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.”

And in an address at the Tennessee home of Andrew Jackson, the nation’s seventh president, Mr. Trump embraced the idea that there were parallels to his own presidency in Jackson’s.

“It was during the Revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite. Does that sound familiar to you?” Mr. Trump asked the crowd, smiling broadly.

“Oh,” he said, “I know the feeling, Andrew.” Paul Ryan Emerges From Health Care Defeat Badly Damaged.

WASHINGTON — For two days in January, all seemed right in the Republican Party.

Gathered in Philadelphia for their annual congressional retreat, less than a week after President Trump’s inauguration, lawmakers exulted in the possibilities of total government control, grinning through forums about an aggressive 200-day agenda that began with honoring a central campaign promise: repealing the Affordable Care Act.

Adult beverages flowed. Members were given Trump-themed socks. And the president showered praise on his most important partner, the man with the bill-writing pen, the man who would find the votes.

“Speaker Paul Ryan — very, very special,” Mr. Trump said. “He is writing his heart out, right? And we’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing.”

“Now,” the president said, “it’s going to happen.”

It is not going to happen. At least not this time.

Less than 18 months after being elected speaker, Mr. Ryan has emerged from the defeat of the health care bill badly damaged, retaining a grip on the job but left to confront the realities of his failure — imperiling the odd-couple partnership that was supposed to sustain a new era of conservative government under unified Republican rule.

So far, to the surprise of some close to Mr. Trump, the president has remained upbeat on Mr. Ryan, a frequent punching bag during the 2016 campaign and an ideological mismatch whose instincts informed the molding and selling of the health bill far more than the president’s own.

But after a humiliating defeat, which many Trump advisers are eager to pin on the speaker, Mr. Ryan is now tasked with defending not just his leadership abilities but his very brand of conservatism in a party fitfully searching for a coherent policy identity that can deliver tangible victories.

In this first fight, Mr. Ryan’s more orthodox right-leaning vision was co-opted only halfheartedly by Mr. Trump, who has few fixed political beliefs, in service of a bill the president never well understood, even as he laid on the superlatives in praising it. Now, Mr. Ryan must tug a ruptured conference toward future agenda items, like overhauling the tax code, made all the more difficult by this initial failure.

“Oh, I’m sure he’ll get blamed,” Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a vocal Trump supporter, said of the speaker as he left the Capitol on Friday, making clear he did not believe this would be fair. “He’ll get blamed for everything.”

The episode not only demonstrated an inability to honor a longstanding pledge that powered Republicans through a string of election cycles. It was also a remarkable setback for Mr. Ryan as the body’s principal arm-twister, in his first major test as the speaker under a Republican president.

In January, he coasted to re-election with almost unanimous party support, prompting allies to gloat that he had tamed the hard-line House Freedom Caucus far more deftly than his predecessor, John A. Boehner.

By Friday, his bill had at once alienated those archconservatives and more moderate members who abandoned the legislation as Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump began caving to demands of the far right, to little effect.

“We were a 10-year opposition party, where being against things was easy to do,” Mr. Ryan said at a sheepish news conference shortly after the bill was pulled, adding with uncharacteristic candor that Republicans were not yet prepared to be a “governing party.”

“We will get there,” Mr. Ryan said, “but we weren’t there today.”

His job will not get easier. With disparate coalitions in his conference, outside groups like the political arm of the Heritage Foundation pushing lawmakers to pursue conservative purity, and a less-than-popular president whom some members have appeared more willing to buck recently, there are few establishment forces helping Mr. Ryan keep the peace.

“There is a lot more safety in opposition than there used to be,” said Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader who was ousted by a more conservative challenger, citing pressure from the outside groups.

At the same time, several Trump allies have suggested that Mr. Ryan has still failed to grasp fully the lessons of the president’s election and its rejection of traditional political dogma. The most ominous signals have proliferated on sites like Breitbart, often the online id of Mr. Trump’s orbit. Its lead headlines on Saturday morning included: “Polls: GOP Legislators Dodged 2018 Headache When Leaders Dropped Ryancare” and “Speaker Ryan Crippled? Replacement Chatter Erupts on Hill.”

But as the bill circled the congressional drain, Republicans appeared broadly supportive of Mr. Ryan, grateful for his steady hand and policy fluency and mindful of the risks he took last year as Mr. Trump’s on-again-off-again campaign nemesis, giving members cover during a tumultuous election cycle.

Most suggested there was nothing he could have done differently to secure the necessary votes.

“If he can’t deliver them, they can’t be delivered,” said Representative Chris Collins of New York, a close Trump ally. “I’m certainly not blaming Paul Ryan in the least.”

Others grew more wistful, recalling that Mr. Ryan had to be coaxed into seizing the speaker’s gavel in the first place.

“He didn’t ask to do it,” said Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota. “We wanted a speaker who could articulate our principles, who could go on everybody’s radio shows and everybody’s TV shows, and go district to district in many cases, selling and articulating our philosophy, as well as sometimes pretty nerdy legislative stuff. He was tireless in that effort.”

A handful of Republicans took veiled swipes at the House leadership as the bill flailed. Representative Justin Amash of Michigan wrote Friday night on Twitter that the House was “supposed to be a deliberative body where outcomes are discovered, not dictated.”

“Compromise & consensus cannot be centrally planned,” said Mr. Amash, a member of the Freedom Caucus.

But the chief wild card, as ever, is Mr. Trump. In his private conversations, the president has remained supportive of Mr. Ryan, declining to join in his advisers’ frustrations over how the bill was handled in the House. One adviser described him as still “smitten” with Mr. Ryan.

“I want to thank Paul Ryan. He worked very, very hard,” Mr. Trump said on Friday. “I will tell you that. He worked very, very hard.”

Mr. Trump’s praise for Mr. Ryan seemed to owe, at least in part, to the fact that the speaker had repeatedly kept him informed throughout the negotiations. Mr. Ryan was also exceedingly deferential to the president, casting him for days as the consummate closer and a winner of the highest order. “The president gave his all in this effort,” he said on Friday. “He’s really been fantastic.”

Dynamics could shift quickly. Several of Mr. Trump’s advisers have for days been casting blame on Mr. Ryan, who is close with the president’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. Mr. Trump is also known to grow angrier over time, particularly if faced with public embarrassment.

On Friday, Mr. Ryan was quick to adopt Mr. Trump’s favored rationale during the health fight, arguing that Republicans had been doing Democrats a grand favor by dismantling President Barack Obama’s health law in the first place and that Democrats would eventually suffer the consequences.

“I’m sure they may be pleased right now,” Mr. Ryan said, but when they see “how bad” things get, “I don’t think they’re going to like that, either.”

Mr. Ryan spoke from the same room where, just two weeks earlier, he delivered a slide show presentation live on cable, holding the attention of the political world — clicker in hand, sleeves peeled above his forearms — with a meditation on insurance premiums and Medicaid spending.

For all the outward displays of collaboration, the exhibition demonstrated the gulfs, both philosophical and stylistic, that divided Mr. Ryan from the Trump White House.

The administration had sought a different visual as the bill debuted to a critical panning: arranging competing stacks of paper in the White House briefing room, meant to demonstrate the relative simplicity of the Republican proposal compared with the thicker Affordable Care Act.

“This is government,” Sean Spicer, the press secretary, said at the time, gesturing first to the Democrats’ bill, then the new one. “This is not.” Trump Becomes Ensnared in Fiery G.O.P. Civil War. WASHINGTON — President Trump ignites a lot of fights, but the biggest defeat in his short time in the White House was the result of a long-running Republican civil war that had already humbled a generation of party leaders before him.

A precedent-flouting president who believes that Washington’s usual rules and consequences of politics do not apply to him, Mr. Trump now finds himself shackled by them.

In stopping the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the Republican Party’s professed priority for the last seven years, the rebellious far right wing of his party out-rebelled Mr. Trump, and won a major victory on Friday over the party establishment that he now leads.

Like every other Republican leader who has tried to rule a fissured and fractious party, Mr. Trump faces a wrenching choice: retrenchment or realignment. Does he cede power to the anti-establishment wing of his party? Or does he seek other pathways to successful governing by throwing away the partisan playbook and courting a coalition with the Democrats he has improbably blamed for his party’s shortcomings?

“It’s really a problem in our own party, and that’s something he’ll need to deal with moving forward,” said Representative Tom Cole, a moderate Republican from Oklahoma who is part of the center-right Tuesday Group, which stuck with Mr. Trump in the health care fight and earned the president’s praise in the hours after the bill’s defeat.

“I think he did a lot — he met with dozens and dozens of members and made a lot of accommodations — but in the end there’s a group of people in this party who just won’t say ‘yes,’” Mr. Cole said. “At some point I think that means looking beyond our conference. The president is a deal maker, and Ronald Reagan cut some of his most important deals with Democrats.”

Mr. Trump is not there yet. So far he is operating from the standard-issue Republican playbook. While he is angry and thirsty for revenge, he seems determined to swallow the loss in hopes of marshaling enough Republican support to pass spending bills, an as-yet unformed tax overhaul and a $1 trillion infrastructure package.

On Friday evening, a somewhat shellshocked president retreated to the White House residence to grieve and assign blame. He asked his advisers repeatedly: Whose fault was this?

Increasingly, that blame has fallen on Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, who coordinated the initial legislative strategy on the health care repeal with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, his close friend and a fellow Wisconsin native, according to three people briefed on the president’s recent discussions.

Mr. Trump, an image-obsessed developer with a lifelong indifference toward the mechanics of governance, made a game effort of negotiating with members of the far-right Freedom Caucus, even if it seemed to some members of that group, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, that he did not have the greatest grasp of health care policy or legislative procedure.

He told one adviser late Friday that his loss — a legislative debacle foreshadowed by the intraparty fight that led to the 2013 government shutdown — was a minor bump in the road and that the White House would recover.

In an interview with The New York Times on Friday, Mr. Trump insisted that the administration was “rocking.” The problem, he suggested, was divisions among Republicans.

There are “a lot of players, a lot of players with a very different mindset,” Mr. Trump said. “You have liberals, even within the Republican Party. You have the conservative players.”

But his advisers were more realistic. Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, according to people familiar with White House discussions, described what happened as a flat-out failure that could inflict serious damage on this presidency — even if Mr. Bannon believes Congress, not Mr. Trump, deserves much of the blame.

Mr. Bannon and the president’s more soft-spoken legislative affairs director, Marc Short, pushed Mr. Trump hard to insist on a public vote, as a way to identify, shame and pressure “no” voters who were killing their last, best chance to unravel the health care law.

One Hill Republican aide who was involved in the last-minute negotiations said Mr. Bannon and Mr. Short were seeking to compile an enemies list. But Mr. Ryan repeatedly counseled the president to avoid seeking vengeance — at least until he has passed spending bills and a debt-ceiling increase needed to keep the government running.

Mr. Trump, bowing to the same power-sharing realities that the besieged Mr. Ryan must cope with in leading the fractured Republican majority in the House, decided to back down. But the president’s advisers worry about the hard reality going forward — the developer with the tough-guy veneer was steamrollered by various factions in the Republican Congress.

The president and his team lamented outsourcing so much of the early bill drafting to Mr. Ryan, and one aide compared their predicament to a developer who has staked everything on obtaining a property without conducting a thorough inspection. Despite the president’s public displays of unity with the speaker, Mr. Trump’s team was privately stunned by Mr. Ryan’s inability to master the politics of his own conference, according to two West Wing aides. The president, they said, is still sizing up Mr. Ryan’s abilities, despite Mr. Trump’s public statements of support.

As the dust settled on the health care debacle, it was clear that Mr. Trump’s lieutenants in the Republican civil war had been divided on how they thought the health care fight should have been handled, which does not augur well for the political battles to come.

Mutual disgust with the Freedom Caucus seems to be pulling Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan together, at least for now — just as it briefly united President Barack Obama and John A. Boehner, Mr. Ryan’s long-suffering predecessor, during their doomed effort to reach a “grand bargain” on a tax overhaul in 2011.

In a meeting before the Republican House conference convened on Thursday night, Mr. Trump’s team met for two hours of negotiations with Freedom Caucus members, leaving them sour and frustrated at the ever-changing list of demands emerging from the group’s leader, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina.

Many on Mr. Trump’s team disengaged from the process even as he dug in.

Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, had originally been tasked with playing a large role in shepherding the legislation from the White House side. But Mr. Cohn had grown leery of the bill, and the White House recognized that Mr. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs and a liberal Democrat, was not a good messenger to deal with recalcitrant conservatives.

Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who returned on Friday from a family skiing trip to Aspen, Colo., had said for weeks that he thought supporting the bill was a mistake, according to two people who spoke with him. The president, according to two Republicans close to the White House, expressed annoyance that Mr. Kushner, who has described himself as a first-among-equals adviser, was not on site during the consequential week of wrangling. And Tom Price, who left Congress to become Mr. Trump’s health and human services secretary, was singled out for blame for the bill’s failure.

Mr. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, took on a bigger role pushing the bill, telling his former colleagues that the president wanted an up-or-down vote on Friday.

Mr. Trump had told allies on Wednesday night that if he did not push for the bill himself, it would not pass. Several, speaking on the condition of anonymity, expressed astonishment that the president had not come to that realization much earlier.

Until the final week, Mr. Trump’s team was deeply divided over whether he should fully commit to a hard sell on a bill they viewed as fundamentally flawed, with Vice President Mike Pence pointedly advising the president to label the effort “Ryancare,” not “Trumpcare,” according to aides.

Mr. Trump brushed aside those concerns in the last few days, and embraced the conventional role as leader of his party. He has one speed when he decides to shift to sales mode, aides said, and he had trouble modulating his tone, issuing cringe-inducing superlatives like “wonderful” to describe an ungainly bill his aides described as anything but.

After it was all over, the president dutifully blamed the Democrats, a party out of power and largely leaderless, after turning his back on their offers to negotiate on a bipartisan package that would have addressed shortcomings in the Affordable Care Act while preserving its core protections for poor and working-class patients.

Several aides advised him the argument was nonsensical, according to a person with knowledge of the interaction.

For Mr. Trump’s Republican opponents, here was poetic revenge served cold. As a candidate in 2016, he initially scoffed at signing a Republican loyalty pledge, at times behaving more like an independent invading the Republican host organism than a normal presidential candidate.

As president, Mr. Trump has left dozens of critical administration jobs unfilled, rejecting stalwart Republican applicants deemed insufficiently loyal to him — and now he is decrying the disloyalty of the 20 to 30 conservative members who outmaneuvered and overpowered him on health care.

“We all learned a lot — we learned a lot about loyalty,” a solemn Mr. Trump told reporters late Friday.

The dynamic that led to his defeat is bigger than Mr. Trump, despite his tendency to personalize every win or loss. Republicans who gained power by savaging Washington are in full control and cannot agree on a path forward.

“We were a 10-year opposition party,” Mr. Ryan said late Friday. “Being against things was easy to do.”

Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, said on Friday, with a chuckle, that he was “getting some déjà vu right now.”

“Do you think Donald J. Trump goes home tonight, shrugs and says, ‘This is what winning looks like’?” Mr. Gingrich added. “No! But this is where the Republican Party is right now, and it’s been this way for years.”

But Mr. Trump put on his best face on Saturday morning. “ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE,” he said on Twitter. “Do not worry!”  When Speaker Paul D. Ryan arrived at the White House on Friday to inform President Trump that the health care bill he had made his first major legislative push could not pass, Mr. Trump had one reaction: He wanted revenge.

Furious at rebellious Republicans who refused to back the measure, Mr. Trump demanded that defectors cast “no” votes for all to see — even if it meant the measure’s high-profile defeat, broadcast live on television.

But over a lunch of chicken, brussels sprouts and twice-baked potatoes in the Oval Office, Mr. Ryan pleaded with Mr. Trump to reconsider.

A loss could do lasting political damage to Republicans who supported the contentious bill, Mr. Ryan argued, especially those in competitive districts who were vulnerable to primary challenges. It would do nothing to isolate or punish the Freedom Caucus, the conservative faction that had resisted the measure all along, he added.

And it could alienate rank-and-file Republicans needed to push through other challenging initiatives in the weeks to come, including an increase in the debt ceiling, a sweeping tax cut and the president’s promised $1 trillion infrastructure package.

Mr. Trump remained unconvinced, but by midafternoon, armed with vote counts showing that the measure lacked a majority to pass, the president called the speaker to agree: You should pull the bill. With repeal and replace now a hollow vow, Mr. Trump’s anger at the defiant members of the Freedom Caucus was undiminished. But trying to put the best possible face on a major defeat late Friday afternoon, he confined his public criticism to Democrats.

“When you get zero from the other side — they let us down because they’re hurting the people,” Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview shortly after he had agreed to pull the measure. Asked whether he was worried the loss would hurt Republicans, he said, “I’ll let you know in a year.”

The demise of the American Health Care Act played out in a tense 24 hours that White House and congressional officials said proved a political education for Mr. Trump and his top advisers on the promise and peril of governing, even with unified Republican control. This account is based on government officials who were present during the last-minute negotiations and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

“We all learned a lot,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday afternoon. “We learned a lot about loyalty, and we learned a lot about the vote-getting process.”

“Certainly for me, it was a very interesting experience,” he added.

Mr. Trump, who initially had little involvement in crafting the health care bill, became more deeply engaged in recent weeks, promoting it at rallies outside Washington and holding meetings in the West Wing with conservative and moderate coalitions whose support was crucial to its passage.

But he made little secret of his ambivalence about addressing the issue — “I would have loved to have put it first, I’ll be honest,” Mr. Trump said of tax reform in Nashville last week — yet he told aides he believed the measure could not pass without a push from him.

By Thursday afternoon, just hours before a scheduled vote, it had become clear that his efforts — along with those of Vice President Mike Pence and other senior White House officials — had fallen short. At a meeting in Mr. Ryan’s office in the Capitol with members of the recalcitrant Freedom Caucus, top White House officials laid out the changes they had made at the group’s behest, including stripping it of federal standards for benefits that must be provided in health insurance policies, including maternity and wellness care.

Caucus members began outlining still more changes they needed to see before they could support the bill, angering Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump’s aides. Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, and Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, told the group that the White House was finished negotiating and that the president wanted to know its position on the bill — yes or no.

Called on in turn to state their positions, several members refused. As tensions rose, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina said that he spoke for the group and that they were not ready to commit. That meant the votes would not be there.

Mr. Ryan postponed the vote and called an evening meeting of House Republicans in the basement of the Capitol. Lawmakers munched on Chick-fil-A takeout as Mr. Mulvaney delivered the president’s ultimatum on the health measure: Fall in line behind it or accept that former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act would be the law of the land. The speaker emerged and told reporters there would be a vote in the morning, rushing away from the news cameras as he was asked if Republicans had the votes.

In a 45-minute telephone call Thursday evening between Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan, the two commiserated over the demands of the caucus and strategized over the prospects for a vote on Friday.

Even as the two spoke, some of Mr. Trump’s advisers were privately expressing frustration with Mr. Ryan, arguing that he had badly misjudged the situation and misled the president into tackling health care before a tax overhaul.

The meeting with the Freedom Caucus had prompted a realization by Mr. Trump and his inner circle about how the group operated, and that offering it policy concessions would not win its support.

By Friday, Mr. Trump was out for blood, eager to call the bluff of the Freedom Caucus and savage it if the health bill went down in defeat. Mr. Bannon and Marc Short, Mr. Trump’s legislative affairs director, both favored holding the vote.

But Mr. Ryan, reluctant to suffer an embarrassing loss or to ask his fellow Republicans to take what could be a politically perilous vote on a measure that had little chance of passing, argued vigorously against it.

White House officials still believed as much as half of the 40-member Freedom Caucus could be pressured into supporting the bill, and Mr. Bannon demanded to see a confidential vote-count list that demonstrated otherwise. The numbers were grim, and Mr. Trump called Mr. Ryan to acquiesce into calling off the vote.

The collapse of the measure dealt Mr. Trump — a professed master dealmaker who campaigned as an agent of change — a remarkable setback in his young presidency, threatening to sap his influence and imperil his ambitious agenda. It also highlighted the importance of a pairing that will shape the Trump era: a president inexperienced in the complexities of politics and uninterested in the nuance of policy, paired with a vulnerable speaker struggling to corral competing coalitions within the Republican Party. “I don’t blame him for a thing, I really don’t,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Ryan in the interview on Friday. “Look, he tried. He tried very hard.”

But one close adviser said that Mr. Trump, who hates looking weak or any form of embarrassment in public, was stewing.

One ally of the president, however, said that he had learned from the process. Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of Mr. Trump, said he thought it was a “blessing in disguise” that the bill had died.

“This bill was a political bullet aimed at the president and congressional Republicans running for office next year,” he said. “On future legislation, he won’t make the same mistakes.”

As Mr. Trump reflected on the health care debacle, the president who had predicted during the campaign that he would win so often that people would become “sick of winning” insisted that he was at peace with the day’s results.

“I’m not disappointed,” he said in the interview. “If I were, I wouldn’t be calling you.”

He said that he was moving on to overhauling the tax system and trade, describing the experience with the health bill as not that different from some of his negotiations as a real-estate developer.

But he acknowledged that he was pleased to have it all behind him.

“It’s enough already,” he said. At the end of the long day, the alliance of conservative ideologues who once shut down the government over President Barack Obama’s health care law could not find the will to repeal it.

Since the Tea Party wave of 2010 that swept House Republicans into power, a raucous, intransigent and loosely aligned group of lawmakers known as the Freedom Caucus — most from heavily Republican districts — has often landed a punch to its own party’s face.

Friday’s defeat of the Republican leadership’s bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act was a return to form, handing an immense defeat to President Trump and embarrassing Speaker Paul D. Ryan in his own House. It also challenged the veracity of their long-held claims that a Republican president was all they needed to get big things accomplished.

The most important question for Republicans now is whether the members of the Freedom Caucus will find themselves newly emboldened in ways that may bring the new president more defeats — or whether Mr. Ryan will do what former Speaker John A. Boehner could not, and find a way to shred their influence for good.

“If you are defined by your opposition to leadership, it’s hard to be part of a governing coalition,” said Alex Conant, a onetime aide to Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who was once a Tea Party star. “Their opposition to Trump’s health care bill should surprise nobody who’s paid attention for the last six years. Even the world’s best negotiator can’t make a deal with someone who never compromises.”

But the Freedom Caucus has never been about compromise. In 2011, it picked a huge, costly fight over Planned Parenthood. In 2013, it orchestrated a government shutdown over funding for the health care law. Then, in its most striking move, it deposed Mr. Boehner in 2015. The common thread: It has continuously been an adversary of legislation itself.

But after years of opposing power — both in the White House, which was occupied by a Democrat, and in the leadership of their own party — the conservatives were offered a chance to negotiate directly with the president and his budget director, a former Freedom Caucus member, over the bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. The members pushed and pushed Mr. Trump to the far right edges of policy, just as they have done for years on other bills. But they still could not get to “yes,” and therefore became part owners of the expansive health law they were trying to undo. “They made the perfect the enemy of the good,” said Representative Roger Marshall, Republican of Kansas. “I don’t know how they can go back home and tell people they voted to keep Obamacare, voted to keep funding Planned Parenthood.”

Indeed, members of the Freedom Caucus — which is supported by outside conservative groups — have often claimed the mantle of pure conservatism, but their tactics have been seen by many in their party as uniformly counterproductive.

Time after time, they undermined Republican leaders’ efforts to secure wins for the conservative cause by overreaching and demanding the impossible.

They have anointed Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina as their leader and principal spokesman. But they occasionally get help from three senators sympathetic to their cause: Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah.

At critical times, House conservatives have forced their party to make deals with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader — an idea anathema to most Republicans, who would seethe.

This time, by negotiating with Mr. Trump on the complex issue of health care, a measure whose complexity he did not seem to fully grasp, they moved an already contentious bill further and further to the right, eliminating too many benefits to keep moderate and other conservative members on board. Even Mr. Trump was said to be taken aback by their attempts to remove things Republicans have long promised to keep, like health insurance benefits for children up to 26 years old.

Given that the House and Senate majorities were built on a promise to repeal and replace Mr. Obama’s signature health care law, many lawmakers fear electoral repercussions. “It is painfully ironic that members from safe, conservative congressional districts who can’t ever quite seem to get to ‘yes’ make it harder to enact good, conservative public policy like repealing Obamacare,” said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist and former aide to Mr. Boehner.

This seemed lost on many Freedom Caucus members on Friday. “Part of the legislative process is working with people who have different ideas,” said Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan. “This process from the beginning wasn’t designed to do that.”

Now, health care has become such a partisan issue that voters seem to have little expectation that their elected officials will do much to solve the problem.

“I believe we should have more attention paid to the centrists in both parties,” said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, one of the early moderate defectors of the bill. “Instead of showing all this attention to three or four people who never vote for anything, let’s do an American health plan, not a Republican or Democrat one.”

Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump offered up a cheerful patina on what many in Washington viewed as an unmitigated failure, one brought on by a group that had brought down the speaker, shuttered the government and needlessly delayed previous legislation with no significant accomplishments to call its own.

And a new test will come soon as Republicans contemplate an overhaul of the tax code, as the fate of the health care bill throws into doubt whether any major legislation can pass in this climate.

To mitigate this issue, Mr. Ryan will be charged with building the sort of outside coalitions that did not exist for the failed health care bill, which was opposed by doctors, nurses, hospitals, disease groups and conservative political action committees.

“There are lessons from this debate that will be applied to upcoming issues like tax reform, infrastructure and financial reform,” said Ken Spain, who served as the National Republican Congressional Committee’s spokesman in 2010. “Debates are won and lost in the districts and states, not in the cloakrooms of Congress.”

“Winning legislative battles today,” he said, “requires more of an outside-in approach.”

They went to unusual, even dangerous lengths to support President Trump’s unpopular health care bill, facing down protesters at home and begging for special accommodation from House leaders in Washington. John Faso of New York negotiated a side deal for his state in exchange for backing it. Mike Coffman was the lone Colorado lawmaker to endorse the bill, while his Republican neighbors agonized and stalled.

But with the collapse of the legislation on Friday, such Republican representatives now have nothing to show for their trouble. They ventured far out on a political limb, only to watch it disintegrate behind them. And when they run for re-election next year, they may have to defend their support for a politically explosive bill that many Republicans backed only reluctantly, and that never came close to reaching the president’s desk.

The fiasco in Washington is already rippling at home: Back in their districts, there are early signs of backlash against these lawmakers, including from constituents who voted Republican last November.

Many voters’ complaints echo the criticism they leveled against the passage of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare: that it was passed too quickly, with too many back-room deals and too much potential to destabilize the insurance system.

At the Kings Valley Diner in Mr. Faso’s district, stretching across the Catskills and north past Albany, the congressman won some harsh reviews. He had at first hesitated over the health care proposal, which the Congressional Budget Office projected would lead to 24 million fewer people having health insurance over a decade. But Republican leaders pursuing Mr. Faso shifted the cost of Medicaid programs away from upstate counties like the ones he represents, and he backed the bill days before it fell apart.

“Faso played that whole thing like an idiot, to be frank,” said Jim Palmatier, 62. “He tried to be a little too clever, and he just ended up looking like a fool. There’s no way I’m voting for him next time around.”

Eating breakfast with his teenage grandson, Mr. Palmatier, who described himself as a conservative, said he wanted to see the Affordable Care Act repealed but had been disappointed with the Republicans’ replacement.

“They tried to get it through so quickly, they barely had time to explain the thing,” he said.

In Representative Adam Kinzinger’s district, a more solidly Republican seat in a largely rural area outside Chicago, even conservative voters voiced unease with Mr. Kinzinger and his party’s sputtering approach to health care. Bill Chivers, 64, a teacher in Onarga, Ill., who said he leaned Republican, questioned whether lawmakers even understood the bill: “Nobody knew what it was. Not even Congress — they don’t even know what it means.”

Anthony McIntyre, 55, who was grilling pork burgers for a fund-raising drive outside the Hometown Family Foods store in Gilman, Ill., said he was relieved that the bill had failed. Mr. McIntyre, who has health coverage through his job in roofing, said he feared that the bill would have led to higher insurance rates.

“They can write it better,” said Mr. McIntyre, who said he regularly voted Republican. “They have to do a better job with it.”

Told that Mr. Kinzinger supported the bill, he was not pleased.

“Oh no, he can’t do that,” Mr. McIntyre said. “Congressman Kinzinger — I might not want to vote for him again.”

In an interview on Saturday, Mr. Kinzinger, 39, said he understood that many voters were concerned about change to the health care system, and suggested that Republicans should now try to work with Democrats on more incremental changes instead of pushing for wholesale repeal.

“Anytime you do something like this, it’s unpopular at first,” he said. “People may dislike the health law in its current form, but they always get nervous for change.”

Mr. Faso, 64, said he did not regret supporting the House health care bill, calling it merely a “partial solution” to a difficult policy problem. He said he had heard from constituents supportive of unwinding the Affordable Care Act, but had also been confronted by anti-repeal protesters as recently as Saturday morning, at an event in New Lebanon.

“I would say that my constituency is pretty divided on this whole question,” Mr. Faso said in an interview. “A lot of people want to see the A.C.A. or a single-payer system and just as many people, in my view, want to see us get rid of the A.C.A. I’m trying to listen to both sides.”
It is not only supporters of the now-abandoned bill, known as the American Health Care Act, who may face censure from voters. Dozens of Republican lawmakers opposed the measure after campaigning for years on a pledge to undo President Barack Obama’s signature achievement. Mr. Trump suggested repeatedly that he might seek to punish Republicans who failed to support the proposal, raising the possibility of primary battles next year.

But it was Democrats who moved fastest to exploit the Republican health care debacle: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced on Saturday that it was running online advertisements against more than a dozen Republicans, including Mr. Faso, who voted for versions of the health care bill when it was being drafted in congressional committees.

Democratic strategists said their private polling found the Trump-backed health care bill to be extremely unpopular, a finding mirrored in public opinion surveys. A Quinnipiac University poll published this past week found that just 17 percent of voters approved of the legislation, compared with 56 percent who disapproved. Three in five independent voters said they were against it.

The Democratic campaign committee said it would even go after Republicans who never endorsed the final version of the bill, if they voted for it in earlier drafts, like Representatives Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Leonard Lance of New Jersey.

The squeeze facing Republicans was evident in Mr. Curbelo’s district, where even voters critical of Obamacare were divided over the Republican strategy for replacing it. Sara Reig, 71, who said she was familiar with the main particulars of the bill, said the party should have been more patient and taken the time to craft a stronger piece of legislation. “What’s the rush?” she asked.

“Better to fix it right and make it clear and really let us know what is in there,” Ms. Reig added. “They want to support the president, which I agree with, but it has to be done right.”

National Republicans, still reeling from their unexpected defeat, expressed hope that health care might fade as an issue before the congressional elections in 2018. With more than a year and a half until voters next pass judgment on the Republican-controlled Congress, party leaders say they have plenty of time to record victories on issues like a tax code overhaul and infrastructure spending. Mr. Trump and Speaker Paul D. Ryan indicated on Friday that they did not intend to revisit health care in the near future.

But Republican strategists also acknowledged that they would probably have to give extra help to vulnerable members of Congress who supported the health care bill. Corry Bliss, the chief strategist for the Congressional Leadership Fund, a “super PAC” backed by Mr. Ryan, said the group would go out of its way to protect lawmakers who backed the bill. “We are committed to helping advance the legislative agenda of House leadership,” Mr. Bliss said on Saturday. “Of course we are going to give preferential treatment to friends and allies.”

By contrast, Mr. Bliss noted that the group had cut off funding to Representative David Young of Iowa, a Republican who opposed the health care bill.

It is unclear whether voters’ anger over health care will be enough to give Democrats a chance at winning a majority in the House next year. Republicans control the chamber by a sizable margin, and the congressional maps in many states were drawn to protect G.O.P. incumbents.

And some voters appeared willing to give their member of Congress a pass on the messy health care process. In Mr. Coffman’s district, anchored in the Denver suburbs, George Markline, 52, said he did not care for the Republican bill, pointing out that it would lead to higher premiums for people who lose their coverage.

Yet Mr. Markline, a Republican, said he believed Obamacare needed some changes and gave Mr. Coffman credit for trying.

“I like the fact that he’s standing up for a change that needs to be done, even though it may not have been fixing everything, as it needs to be,” said Mr. Markline, who works logistics at a warehouse.

But other voters who once eagerly supported Republican opponents of Obamacare said the last few weeks had given them second thoughts.

In Kingston, N.Y., on the eastern edge of Mr. Faso’s district, Sal Traficante, the owner of a small construction business, said he had begun to question his support for Republicans.

Mr. Traficante, 57, said he wanted the Affordable Care Act to be modified, but was dismayed at the thought of tens of millions of people losing health care coverage. “Those are working people who need the coverage,” he said.

Mr. Traficante said he was disappointed by the Republicans: “I liked the idea of repealing Obamacare, but I thought the Republicans would actually have a plan.” The American-led military coalition in Iraq said Saturday that an initial review of recent airstrikes in Mosul, the Islamic State’s last stronghold in Iraq, had confirmed that the strikes hit a site where scores of civilians were killed.

The inquiry, military officials said, found that a building had collapsed a few days after strikes by American forces. United States officials are seeking to determine whether the airstrikes brought down the building, leaving many Iraqis dead, or the Islamic State used the strikes as an opportunity to detonate an explosive in the building.

The Pentagon had acknowledged on Friday that it was investigating reports that its airstrikes had caused deaths in Mosul. The next phase of the investigation, military officials said, is likely to take about three weeks.

The March 17 airstrikes — which Iraqis said had led to the deaths of possibly 200 people — could have produced among the highest civilian death tolls in an American air mission since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003.

The reports of heavy civilian casualties have come at a critical point in the military campaign to defeat the Islamic State. Iraqi officials said that the Trump administration had appeared to loosen restrictions on the rules of engagement, making it easier for the Iraqis to call in airstrikes. The Iraqis had been frustrated by the Obama administration’s deliberate approach.

Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the rules had not been loosened.

The coalition said in a statement on Saturday that the airstrikes had been conducted “at the request of the Iraqi security forces,” and that it believed it was hitting Islamic State fighters and equipment.

“The coalition respects human life, which is why we are assisting our Iraqi partner forces in their effort to liberate their lands from ISIS brutality,” the statement said. “Our goal has always been for zero civilian casualties, but the coalition will not abandon our commitment to our Iraqi partners because of ISIS’s inhuman tactics terrorizing civilians, using human shields, and fighting from protected sites such as schools, hospitals, religious sites and civilian neighborhoods.”

It added: “Coalition forces work diligently and deliberately to be precise in our airstrikes. Coalition forces comply with the Law of Armed Conflict and take all reasonable precautions during the planning and execution of airstrikes to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.”

The civilian deaths occurred in the recently liberated neighborhood of Mosul Jidideh, and reports of mass casualties began emerging on Thursday, six days after the coalition said it had struck the area. That lapse may have been a result of delays in getting rescue workers to the area, some of whom traveled from Baghdad, 250 miles away.
U.S.-Led Coalition Confirms Strikes Hit Mosul Site Where Civilians Died.

Iraqis on Saturday continued to pull bodies from the rubble, as families held hastily arranged funerals for the victims, some of whom were buried in mass graves, shrouded by blue tarpaulins, according to photographs and videos shared on social media.

In one video, Basma Basim, the head of Mosul’s provincial council, stood in front of destroyed buildings where the strikes occurred and said that dozens “of innocent women, men, old men and children’s bodies, are in these homes and shops behind me — we couldn’t save them.”

She added, “All the men I met had a wife, sister or children buried under the rubble, at least 20 persons died for each.”

The battle for Mosul, now in its sixth month, has taken a heavy toll on civilians, with the Islamic State gathering civilians to use as human shields and, lately, with reports of growing numbers of deaths from airstrikes.

The Iraqi Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said in a statement that more than 3,800 civilians had been killed in the battle for western Mosul, which began in January. On the eastern side of the city, which was declared liberated in January after months of fighting, 2,190 civilians were killed, the group said.

In a statement on Saturday, Lise Grande, the United Nations’ top humanitarian official for Iraq, said, “We are stunned by this terrible loss of life and wish to express our deepest condolences to the many families who have reportedly been impacted by this tragedy.”

She added: “Parties to the conflict — all parties — are obliged to do everything possible to protect civilians. This means that combatants cannot use people as human shields and cannot imperil lives through indiscriminate use of firepower.”

Iraq’s Ministry of Defense, which works closely with the American military, broke two days of silence on Saturday when it said that it was opening an investigation into the civilian deaths. At the same time, the speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, Salim al-Jubouri, ordered commanders of Iraq’s security forces to give lawmakers a report on the matter and to appear before the assembly. Friday’s collapse of Republican plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act has broad implications not only for the nation’s health care system, but also for the fate of President Trump’s ambitious agenda in his young and chaotic presidency.

On Capitol Hill, the failure of newly empowered Republicans to make good on their biggest campaign-year promise exposes the deep divisions that remain in the party. It also, importantly, raises profound dangers ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Taken together, the lessons for the new president and his Republican allies are difficult but necessary if they want to succeed in making progress during the next three and a half years.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on Friday that the lesson from defeat is that “doing big things is hard.” Republicans, he said, are eager to “step up our game, to deliver on our promises.”

Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office after admitting defeat, said he had “learned a lot about the vote-getting process” and called the legislative failure an “interesting experience.”

For both men, those comments almost certainly understate the impact of Friday’s stunning outcome. Here are five takeaways from the day:

The Survival of Obamacare

The most obvious result from the Republican failure on Friday is the immediate survival of the Affordable Care Act. Those who want to buy plans from HealthCare.gov can continue to do so. Families covered by Medicaid will still have insurance. People who saw premiums rise or choices shrink will remain frustrated. And the eight-year political war over the law will continue to be waged.

Democrats crowed when Republicans pulled back their repeal. But the celebrating will be temporary, as Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland noted. “Americans can breathe a small sigh of relief,” he said in a statement, “for now.” The Republican assault on President Barack Obama’s health care law may continue even without a legislative overhaul as administration officials continue to pick away at its regulatory underpinnings.

The Affordable Care Act was always designed to require continuing support to succeed. Each year, the federal government mounts an advertisement campaign to boost enrollment — something that may no longer happen in a Trump administration. Other regulatory changes could cause problems for the stability of the insurance marketplaces.

The dangers to the law were underscored by Mr. Trump himself, moments after Republicans abandoned their legislative efforts. “When it explodes, they’ll come to me to make a deal,” Mr. Trump told The New York Times’s Maggie Haberman. Any hope that Friday’s experience might encourage Mr. Trump to work with Democrats to fix the law’s shortcomings died with that statement.

“Today’s result is seven years in the making,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. “The Republicans focused all of their health care energy on the Obama part and none of the care of Obamacare, and therefore were terribly ill-prepared for the moment it came time to actually do something.”

Trump’s Personal Capital

Mr. Trump won the White House by selling an image. He told people he was the dealmaker who would get his way — with foreign leaders, chief executives and with Congress — through the strength of his personality and his negotiating skills.

That, more than anything, was undercut by Friday’s failure. Having fundamentally misread the likelihood of success, Mr. Trump and his advisers fully embraced the health care legislation. While the president never slapped his name on the bill, he happily accepted the personal challenge of getting it passed.

“By our count,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, bragged just hours before the bill died, “over 120 members have personally had a visit, call or meeting here at the White House in the past few days, which is an extraordinary feat.”

Having invested his political capital in the outcome of the legislation, Mr. Trump’s personal brand has been diminished, according to Republicans who watched the health care debate.

“This is a moment of time, when you’re skulking around the family chambers in the White House residence, where you take stock of where you are,” said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who helped run Senator John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008.

“It’s a startling setback,” Mr. Schmidt added. Mr. Trump and the Republican Party are moving on. Having spent 64 of his first 100 days pursuing an ultimately futile effort to overhaul health care, the president now must move quickly to try to make good on his other promises — tax reform, a border wall and investment in infrastructure.

That may all be harder now. Lawmakers who disagree with Mr. Trump have seen him buckle in the face of pressure. And Republican lawmakers may be inspired by the success of the Freedom Caucus — which wanted to defeat the health care legislation — to fight for their own interests.

That may be particularly dangerous during an effort to overhaul the nation’s tax code. That process is famously difficult, with every change producing winners and losers, all of them ably represented by powerful lobbies.

Mr. Trump seems unfazed — or unaware — of that prospect. In comments to reporters, Mr. Trump vowed to “start going very, very strongly for the big tax cuts and tax reform. That will be next.”

If tax reform becomes defined just as “big tax cuts,” the president might find a more unified Republican Party on Capitol Hill. But if he seeks fundamental changes to the kinds of deductions and credits that have been added over decades, he may soon face similar intraparty disagreements.

Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said at an event sponsored by Axios on Friday that he thought tax reform would be “simpler” than passing health reform. But lobbyists from almost every industry have been busily chipping away at parts of the proposal that Mr. Ryan drafted last summer and that powerful groups such as the billionaire Koch brothers, the Club for Growth and the National Retail Federation have come out against.

Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is hopeful nonetheless.

“This made a big challenge more challenging but it’s not insurmountable, so we’re going to pivot straight to this and just roll forward,” Mr. Brady said on Fox News.

But even as Mr. Trump and Republicans try to turn to other agenda items, the 2018 midterm elections loom large on the horizon.

Most presidents face losses during their first midterm elections, as voters take their first opportunity to express their opinions of his presidency. And few have had the kind of difficult first year that Mr. Trump has already endured, including approval ratings that are in the 30s — much lower than most of his predecessors.

Republican lawmakers will head home for spring break next month to explain the health reform failure. Conservatives may brag that they prevented something worse. But many voters will struggle to understand why a repeal didn’t happen with Republicans in full control in Washington.

“They are going to blame the feckless, corrupt Republican Congress that they’ve always hated,” Mr. Schmidt predicted. “Dark and ominous clouds are about to blow in over Mount Election 2018.”

The best electoral hope for most Republican lawmakers may be to move away quickly from Friday’s loss.

But election season — a time when legislative success is usually hard to achieve — will come more rapidly than they like. Lawmakers often say legislating is only really possible in the first 200 days of a president’s term.

“The challenge there is that for a lot of big-ticket legislative items, you have a very small window to make big gains on those initiatives,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former top adviser to Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 Republican nominee.

“A good amount of time has already been spent,” Mr. Madden said. “You have to quickly move to reorient your agenda so you can maximize your time.”
The Trump administration’s negotiations with the Israeli government are expected to yield only a general commitment — and not a specific pledge — to slow the building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, an administration official briefed on the talks said on Friday.

The White House believes it is unrealistic to expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sign on to an agreement that sets numerical or geographic limitations on construction, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Instead, the official said, the United States would measure success by whether there was evidence that construction was slowing down — a trend that President Trump has said is important to create the conditions for a peace accord between the Israelis and Palestinians.

Such a vague agreement would be less than some hoped for, especially after Mr. Trump last month unexpectedly raised the rapid spread of settlements as a roadblock to a potential peace deal.

“I’d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Netanyahu on Feb. 15, during the Israeli premier’s visit to the White House. “We’ll work something out.”

Mr. Netanyahu replied, “Let’s try it,” prompting Mr. Trump to joke, “Doesn’t sound too optimistic, but he’s a good negotiator.”

On Thursday, a delegation of senior aides to Mr. Netanyahu left Washington after four days of talks with a White House team that left the settlements issue unresolved. A White House statement said administration officials had reiterated Mr. Trump’s “concerns” about the impact of new settlements on the prospects for peace.

But the statement added that the “Israeli delegation made clear that Israel’s intent going forward is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes those concerns into consideration.”

Mr. Trump surprised virtually everybody when he raised Israeli settlements as an issue after taking office. Many in Israel expected that, given his unstinting support of Mr. Netanyahu during the campaign and his vow to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, he would give the Israelis carte blanche to expand settlement construction.

Instead, the administration put the embassy move on the back burner. And Mr. Trump told an Israeli newspaper, Israel Hayom, that he viewed settlements as unhelpful for a peace accord. “Every time you take land for settlements,” he said, “there is less land left.”

The last time Mr. Netanyahu tangled with a president over settlements, the dispute played out publicly: President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, demanded that Israel cease all construction — “not some settlements, not outposts, not natural-growth exceptions.” This time, the two sides appear determined to work out an understanding privately, so as not to undermine the rapport the two leaders have established.

Extracting a deal from Mr. Netanyahu in current circumstances would be tricky. The Israeli leader is politically more vulnerable than he was eight years ago, when Mr. Obama demanded that he freeze all construction.

Right-wing members of his coalition are committed to the settler movement and Mr. Netanyahu, several experts said, cannot afford to look as if he is yielding too quickly to Mr. Trump’s pressure.

“He can’t square the circle,” said Martin S. Indyk, who served as special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Obama administration. “He can’t agree to a freeze and keep his coalition.”

But Mr. Netanyahu, experts said, could also use his new rapport with Mr. Trump to his advantage. The standoff over settlements helped poison Mr. Netanyahu’s relationship with Mr. Obama, and the Israeli leader can argue that it must not be allowed to do the same with Mr. Trump.

“I don’t think you can come to a quick deal,” said Dennis B. Ross, who also advised Mr. Obama and several other presidents on the peace process. “It looks like there is a context being created for an agreement later on.”

Previous administrations have struggled in their attempts to negotiate deals on settlements. The Obama administration managed to get Mr. Netanyahu to agree to a 10-month moratorium on construction, which was meant to open a window for talks between Israel and the Palestinians. But the 2010 process went nowhere, in part because the Palestinians did not come to the table until the moratorium was close to expiring, and Mr. Netanyahu refused to extend it.

Mr. Trump has named a longtime lawyer from his real estate company, Jason D. Greenblatt, to lead the negotiations with Israel. Mr. Greenblatt reports to Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, who did not take part in this week’s negotiations. Mr. Greenblatt has tasked a National Security Council official from the Obama administration, Yael Lempert, to help in the talks, which has fanned criticism from the right wing in Israel.

“These guys are learning on the run,” said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel and Egypt. “They’re also understanding that you can get snookered here.”

Mr. Kurtzer, who was involved during the George W. Bush administration in trying to set specific limits to settlement construction, said the process was bewildering in its complexity. Defining settlement blocs, and defining permissible construction within them, is open to endless debate, he said.

Settlements have become increasingly contentious at the United Nations as well. It is arguably the most politically delicate issue for the new secretary general, António Guterres, as he seeks to create a working relationship with the Trump administration, which has accused the organization of a deep anti-Israel bias.

Anything that the administration considers hostile to Israel, Mr. Guterres knows, could be used to alienate both the White House and influential members of Congress who exert enormous influence over American financial support for the 193-member United Nations.

The Security Council voted in a Dec. 23 resolution to condemn the Israeli settlements as illegal and demand that Israel halt their construction, arguing they constituted a major obstacle to peace talks. Mr. Trump, president-elect at the time, expressed fury at the Obama administration for having abstained in that vote instead of blocking it with a veto.

At the Security Council on Friday, the secretary general’s special envoy for the Middle East, Nickolay Mladenov, said in his first report since the resolution was adopted that Israel not only had failed to comply with the demand on settlements, but had undertaken a big expansion, of more than 5,000 units. Mr. Mladenov called the expansion “deeply concerning” and said that the “territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian state” is threatened.

“Such actions are in breach of international law and they must stop,” Mr. Mladenov said. “Settlement expansion undermines the very essence of a two-state solution.” Cardinal William H. Keeler, who as archbishop of Baltimore strove to improve relations between the Roman Catholic Church and American Jews, and who championed victims of sexual abuse by priests, died on Thursday in Catonsville, Md. He was 86.

No cause was specified, but he was injured in a car accident in 2006 and had undergone brain surgery since then, an archdiocesan spokesman said.

As leader of the oldest Roman Catholic diocese in the United States and later as president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (now the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops), Cardinal Keeler was considered a centrist.

Though he held to the church’s well-established positions against abortion, same-sex marriage, human cloning and stem cell research from fetal tissue, he also led bishops in denouncing racism, welfare cutbacks and the scapegoating of immigrants. And he disagreed with more conservative bishops by opposing a flat ban on offering communion to politicians who supported abortion rights.

Cardinal Keeler was at the forefront of building interfaith bonds between his church and Jews, Muslims and the Greek Orthodox as well as Lutherans and other Protestant groups.

In 1987, as chairman of the bishops’ conference Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs, he was instrumental in arranging Pope John Paul II’s meetings with Jewish leaders in Miami and with Protestant leaders in Columbia, S.C. And he was credited with playing influential roles in the Vatican’s decision in 1993 to establish diplomatic relations with Israel and in a statement by American bishops in 2002 disavowing attempts to convert Jews to Christianity.

“He came from the pioneering generation of post-1965 Catholic leaders,” said Rabbi James Rudin, the senior interreligious adviser of the American Jewish Committee. “There has been more positive done in Catholic-Jewish relations in the last 50 years than in the first 1,900, and Cardinal Keeler was the chief architect of that.”

His response to the sexual abuse scandals was halting at first. When The Boston Globe riveted nationwide attention in 2002 with its reports of widespread abuse by priests along with church efforts to cover up the scandal, Cardinal Keeler took issue with the news media, accusing them of creating a “feeding frenzy.”

But within a few months he became the first bishop to publicly identify priests who had been credibly accused of child abuse. He posted the names of 57 on the website of his archdiocese, along with an accounting of the $5.6 million that he said the archdiocese had paid up to that point in settlements, legal fees and counseling.

Other bishops, emboldened, did the same.

Victims and their advocates praised Cardinal Keeler, but defenders of the church criticized him and the other bishops as having betrayed the priests in their dioceses.

“I think Cardinal Keeler has taken a very bold and courageous and pastorally sensitive approach,” Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the bishops’ conference, said at the time.

In 2002, Cardinal Keeler testified on behalf of a man who had been accused of attempted murder in the shooting of a priest who was later convicted of molesting him as a teenager. The man, Dontee D. Stokes, was acquitted of felony charges.

William Henry Keeler was born on March 4, 1931, in San Antonio, to Thomas Henry, who sold steel products, and the former Margaret Conway, a schoolteacher. He was raised in Lebanon, Pa.

An Eagle Scout who mingled with boys of other faiths, William decided on the priesthood early on.

“I wondered about a way of saying thank you to God and giving back to the church the gifts that God had given to me,” he told The Catholic Review of Baltimore. “It was as simple as that. For me, becoming a priest was not complicated.”

He graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, Pa., in 1952. He earned another bachelor’s degree from St. Charles Seminary at Overbrook in Philadelphia. He received both a licentiate in sacred theology and a doctorate in canon law from Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.

After being ordained in 1955, he was a special adviser at the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s. He was bishop of Harrisburg, Pa., from 1983 to 1989, when he was named archbishop of Baltimore, a statewide diocese with nearly 500,000 congregants. He was appointed a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 1994.

In Baltimore, he raised tens of millions of dollars to maintain the Catholic school system and to restore the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the country’s first Roman Catholic cathedral.

He is survived by a sister, Julia A. Keeler Graham. Former Penn State President Found Guilty in Sandusky Abuse Case. Five years after a child sex abuse scandal rocked Penn State, damaging its reputation, exposing a revered coach as a serial predator and sending him to prison, a jury on Friday convicted the former president of the university of child endangerment for failing to stop the abuse.

On its second day of deliberations, the jury in Harrisburg, Pa., found Graham B. Spanier guilty of one misdemeanor count, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He was also found not guilty of two felony charges, for his handling of allegations against Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant coach.

Mr. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 young boys and was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. In 2013, Penn State agreed to pay $59.7 million to 26 sexual abuse victims in exchange for an end to their claims against the university.

The extent and nature of the abuse shocked the State College, Pa., community, upended a university that has long adored its vaunted football program and badly tarnished the reputation of the beloved head coach, Joe Paterno, who was among those suspected of turning a blind eye to his assistant’s conduct. The fallout was swift and far-reaching in higher education, sports and even state politics.

Mr. Paterno, an icon on campus and the most victorious coach in major college football, was dismissed, and died soon after. Much of his coaching staff was dismissed. The university commissioned an investigative report that harshly criticized Mr. Spanier and other administrators, though he disputed its findings.

Mr. Spanier, once a well-liked leader who oversaw a period of expansion, was removed as president, though Penn State confirmed on Friday that he remained a tenured faculty member, on paid leave. Tim Curley, the athletic director, and Gary Schultz, a senior vice president, were forced to leave.

When Kathleen G. Kane ran for state attorney general in 2012, one of her main themes was that Gov. Tom Corbett had dragged his feet on the Penn State investigation when he was attorney general, part of a male power structure that she said protected its own. But the cases against Mr. Spanier, Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz, brought after she was elected, sputtered after legal delays, and some of the charges were dropped. Ultimately, the proceedings against the three men outlasted Ms. Kane, who fell from power in her own scandal, convicted of perjury and abuse of her office.

Mr. Schultz and Mr. Curley, who pleaded guilty last week to one misdemeanor charge each, testified for the prosecution.

The three men had been told of possible sexual assault, but “instead of reporting it to authorities, they consciously turned their backs and the abuse continued,” Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s attorney general, said after the verdict. “These leaders endangered the welfare of children by both their actions and inactions. There are zero excuses when it comes to failing to report the abuse of children to the appropriate authorities.”

Sam Silver, Mr. Spanier’s lawyer, said, “There always have been substantial questions in this case that need to be reviewed and resolved by the appellate courts, and we fully intend to pursue an appeal.”

The scandal was one in a series of recent cases sending a message that campus crimes — particularly sex crimes — cannot be kept as quiet, or treated as lightly, as they once were. Administrators have been fired from several colleges and universities that failed to report assaults or treat them seriously, including Kenneth W. Starr, who was removed last year as president of Baylor University.

“College administrators have been put on notice that if you know an employee is sexually assaulting people and you leave them in place, you could be held responsible, including legally responsible,” said John D. Foubert, a professor of higher education at Oklahoma State University who has written extensively on campus sexual assault.

But the circumstances at Penn State set it far apart from most campus sexual assault cases: It involved the abuse of children, a nationally renowned sports program and the downfall of Mr. Paterno. And the criminal charges that resulted, not just against the attacker but against administrators accused of covering up his crimes, have no parallel in recent memory.

The count on which Mr. Spanier was convicted was charged as a felony, but the jury instead chose to convict him of the misdemeanor version of it. The jury acquitted him of another felony count of child endangerment, and a charge of conspiracy, also a felony. “I’d be foolish to be disappointed,” said Laura Ditka, the deputy attorney general who was the lead prosecutor. Asked if she would seek jail time for Mr. Spanier, who remained free on bail, she said, “We aren’t there yet.”

Children’s advocates called the administrators’ convictions a victory for accountability. “We can no longer put institutional loyalty above protecting kids,” said Cathleen Palm, the founder of the Center for Children’s Justice, a nonprofit that pushed for changes to Pennsylvania’s child abuse policies in the wake of the scandal.

Supporters of Mr. Spanier and Mr. Paterno held up the acquittal on the conspiracy charge as vindication. “The story should be that there was no conspiracy to cover up child abuse at Penn State,” said Maribeth Roman Schmidt, the executive director of Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship, an alumni group opposed to the sudden ouster of Mr. Paterno and the administrators.

Mr. Spanier has long maintained that he was unaware of the seriousness of the accusations against Mr. Sandusky, who prosecutors said met his victims through his charity work, drawing them in with trips to football games and other gifts. The trial, which began with jury selection on Monday after years of legal delays, offered victims and their families the possibility of new information about what the university’s highest-ranking officials knew about Mr. Sandusky. Supporters of Mr. Spanier and the administration hoped it would absolve the university of some wrongdoing.

“In the view of the jury, with respect to Spanier, and by their own admission, as to Curley and Schultz, these former leaders fell short,” Penn State said in a statement released after the verdict. “And while we cannot undo the past, we have rededicated ourselves and our university to act always with the highest integrity, in affirming the shared values of our community.”

Mr. Spanier sued the university, accusing it of violating their separation agreement. The university countersued, seeking to recoup more than $5 million it has paid him.

Prosecutors contended that Mr. Spanier, along with Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz, was aware of a 2001 report that Mr. Sandusky had showered with a young boy at the university, but that they failed to tell the authorities, acting instead to keep the matter quiet. That choice, prosecutors said, allowed Mr. Sandusky to keep abusing boys for years.

They have often pointed to an email written by Mr. Spanier about the episode, after the decision was made to go to Mr. Sandusky directly and tell him to get counseling, rather than alerting the authorities.

“The only downside for us is if the message isn’t ‘heard’ and acted upon, and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it,” Mr. Spanier wrote. That could be assessed later, he wrote. For now, he said, speaking to Mr. Sandusky directly was a “humane and a reasonable way to proceed.”

Prosecution witnesses included Mike McQueary, a former assistant coach who testified that he had told Mr. Paterno, Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz that he had seen Mr. Sandusky molesting the boy in the shower. A victim of Mr. Sandusky’s who said he was abused in 2002 also testified at Mr. Spanier’s trial.

Mr. Spanier’s lawyers called no witnesses in his defense, but, according to news media reports, told the jury that prosecutors had failed to provide evidence that he knew Mr. Sandusky was accused of sexual abuse. Instead, they said, he made a “judgment call” and took action about what he knew.

Mr. Spanier’s lawyers have said that the charges against him were politically motivated and an attempt to distract from state prosecutors’ failures to stop Mr. Sandusky sooner.

In Washington’s Daily Trump Wars, Devin Nunes Becomes a Human Shield. Even on Fox News, Representative Devin Nunes, the beleaguered Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, could not escape the venom from his left.

Mr. Nunes, the California lawmaker, stood inside the Capitol’s Statuary Hall on Thursday evening, assuming a familiar set of positions: in front of a camera, giving cover to President Trump and defending himself.

The subject this time was his decision on Wednesday to brief Mr. Trump, whose campaign his committee is investigating, about possible “incidental” surveillance of the president or his associates. “I still think it’s the right call,” Mr. Nunes said of his decision not to tell members of his committee about his trip to the White House.

But as he spoke inside the Capitol, a committee colleague, Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, peered into a different camera, belonging to CNN, a few feet to the left. “It is almost inconceivable,” Mr. Himes said of his chairman’s behavior, more than loud enough to hear nearby. “Lo and behold, a couple of hours later, Donald Trump gets to put the barest of fig leaves on the outrageous tweet about Barack Obama wiretapping him.”

Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Nunes has proved an eager purveyor of executive fig leaves. As the leader of an investigation involving the campaign of a man he cheered vocally and served directly as a transition team official, the congressman has often appeared almost incurious about the chief subject of the inquiry.

Of greater concern in the intelligence sphere is his recent burst of media exposure, with a public speaking style that can at times seem cavalier while discussing sensitive information. This has led to misgivings about sharing national security details with him, a senior American intelligence official said.

Many lawmakers crave attention, racing to microphones and pounding lecterns in search of cable news glory. But Mr. Nunes, who can seem by turns earnest and reticent in person, is something different: After over a decade in the House, he has appeared to lurch haphazardly into the spotlight, like Kramer entering a room on “Seinfeld,” straining to keep his balance as a human shield in Washington’s daily Trump wars.

Mr. Nunes said on Fox News that he felt he “had a duty and obligation” to tell Mr. Trump about the possible surveillance. “Because as you know, he’s taking a lot of heat in the news media.”

Now the president has company in that regard: Mr. Nunes, a former dairy farmer, elected to Congress in 2002 at age 29, from a deep-red section of a deep-blue state. The Democratic National Committee has even adopted a new label for him: “White House stooge.”

It was not always thus. Mr. Nunes was 23 when he was first elected to public office, as a board member of a local community college where he had started his higher education. Eyeing his first campaign, Mr. Nunes sought advice from Representative Jim Costa, a Democrat who is also from the Central Valley in California and was serving in the State Legislature at the time.

Both belonged to the area’s tight-knit Portuguese community. Mr. Costa said he recognized a familiar drive. “We all show that kind of interest when we’re in our 20s and 30s, and we want to try to get an opportunity to see if we can make a difference,” Mr. Costa said.

Until recently, Mr. Nunes’s most memorable flourish in the House was his blistering assessment in 2013 of Republicans who were willing to shut down the federal government over President Obama’s health law: “lemmings with suicide vests.”

Now, he has largely retained the support of his colleagues, despite complaints from Republicans like Senator John McCain of Arizona over his committee stewardship, amplifying calls for an independent commission to investigate Mr. Trump’s connections to Russia.

On Friday, Mr. Nunes summoned reporters once more to relay information that Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman with questionable ties to Russia, had volunteered to appear before the committee. Mr. Nunes also announced the cancellation of a public meeting with former intelligence and law enforcement leaders, citing a desire to bring in James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, for a closed session instead. Both testified before the committee this week.

Representative Adam Schiff of California, the committee’s top Democrat, suggested that once again the chairman had acted unilaterally, this time to scuttle the hearing. And in a sign of how far their relationship has fallen, Mr. Schiff — who for weeks stood by Mr. Nunes’s side before reporters and defended him — accused him of taking that action because the White House had told him to.

This was the capper to an eventful few days for Mr. Nunes.

Presiding over a committee hearing on Monday — when Mr. Comey took the extraordinary step of announcing the agency’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election — Mr. Nunes mustered deeper alarm over anonymous sources revealing an inquiry’s details to journalists than over the contents of the investigation.

On Wednesday, he told reporters he had received information that Mr. Trump or members of his team may have been “incidentally” swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. Pressed on whether the White House had provided him the information to produce a “feedback loop” that might aid the president, Mr. Nunes has declined to reveal his sources, saying he does not want to discourage others from coming forward — a rationale analogous to reporters’ arguments for protecting anonymous sources.

It has also not always been entirely clear what Mr. Nunes is talking about.

“Was the president also part of that incidental collection, his communications?” one reporter asked on Wednesday.

“Yes,” Mr. Nunes said, after glancing at the floor for a moment. Heads snapped up from their phones and notepads.

“Excuse me, let me just clarify,” another reporter began. “The president of the United States’ personal communications were intercepted as an incidental part of intelligence gathering —”

Mr. Nunes appeared to reconsider. “When we talk about intelligence products here, we’ve got to be very careful,” he said.

By Thursday evening, he still did not seem certain about the contents of what he had divulged. He has said he could decipher the identities of Trump associates from reading reports about intercepted communications that were shared among Obama administration officials with top security clearances. But he has stressed that he did not have evidence to support Mr. Trump’s claim of being personally wiretapped.

Regardless, the president and some allies have seized on the comments as validation.

“I mean, look, my guess is there’s probably a lot more than what I was able to see,” Mr. Nunes said, when asked if Mr. Trump was indeed vindicated. “And then he’ll have to make up his own mind.”

Democrats have said that Mr. Nunes apologized for leaving them out of the loop. Mr. Nunes, who said he would not do anything differently if given the chance, said he understood why some were upset. But he chafed at discussions of his private conversations.

“That stuff,” he said, “is not supposed to leak out.” Washington Pizzeria Gunman Pleads Guilty to Weapons Charges. A 28-year-old North Carolina man pleaded guilty Friday in federal court to firing a military-style assault rifle inside a Washington pizza restaurant as he investigated spurious claims in online articles that the pizzeria was at the center of a child sex-slave ring.

The man, Edgar Maddison Welch, of Salisbury, N.C., also admitted that he transported a firearm and ammunition across state lines, a federal charge. He faces up to two decades in prison on both felony charges, but prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed he should serve no more than a maximum of seven years.

Mr. Welch, who remains in custody, is scheduled to be sentenced in June.

According to prosecutors, Mr. Welch traveled on Dec. 4 from North Carolina to the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in Northwest Washington after reading unfounded online reports that the restaurant had been harboring child sex slaves as part of a child-abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic nominee for president. Prosecutors said Mr. Welch also watched YouTube videos about the false stories.

The authorities said Mr. Welch told friends that he was “sacrificing the lives of a few for the lives of many” and “standing up against a corrupt system that kidnaps, tortures and rapes babies and children in our own backyard.” Prosecutors said his friends declined to help carry out his mission.

While driving, Mr. Welch sent messages and made a video suggesting he might not return home alive.

Mr. Welch was armed with an AR-15 rifle, a .38-caliber revolver and a shotgun when he arrived at the restaurant. At about 3 p.m., he walked into the pizzeria with the rifle and holstered handgun, which was visible to employees and patrons. He left the shotgun in the car.

Prosecutors said people inside the restaurant panicked and fled. While inside, Mr. Welch fired his rifle into a locked door and also pointed the weapon at an employee carrying pizza dough.

Mr. Welch spent about 20 minutes inside the restaurant and then walked unarmed outside, where he was arrested. Prosecutors said Mr. Welch left the rifle and handgun in the restaurant.

In an interview with The New York Times shortly after his arrest, Mr. Welch said he had gone to the restaurant with good intentions. He said the “thought of innocent people suffering” broke his heart. But he also said he regretted how he handled the situation.

Headed North, Sandhill Cranes Squeeze In Where They Can

You’ll hear it before you see it.

The ancient call of a single crane can trumpet out for miles. And when they all cry out at once the sound multiplies by the tens or hundreds of thousands.

Each spring, around half a million sandhill cranes descend upon a small stretch of the Platte River in Nebraska on their way north to Canada, Alaska and Siberia, from their winter homes in Mexico and the Southwest. Starting around Valentine’s Day through the first half of April, they rest there to prepare for nesting up north.

Thousands of visitors come from all over the world to greet them. This year, biologists at the Crane Trust estimated around 400,000 cranes roosted at the migration’s peak between March 8 and 16. But a quarter-million or so cranes are still gracing the valley with their majesty. As tours become less packed, now is a good time to see them — and hear them.

“The experience — maybe even 60 to 70 percent of it is the sounds,” said Bill Taddicken, director of the Iain Nicolson Audubon Center at Rowe Sanctuary in Nebraska. “It sounds a lot like a football stadium when your favorite team scores a touchdown.”

Mr. Taddicken says you cannot see the birds, which migrate thousands of feet above the earth, until they descend.

“These tiny little specks of pepper in the sky will emerge, and then they’ll drop down, become cranes, and they’re here,” he said.

In a single day, the number of birds in the valley can increase by 50,000 or 100,000, crowding the skies like monkeys in “The Wizard of Oz,” Mr. Taddicken said.

But this Oz is real — and critical — for the nearly 80 percent of the world’s sandhill crane population that arrives here.

The river, agricultural fields and wet meadows provide all the protection and nutrients they need to become fit and stock up on energy for nesting. During their brief stay, they can pack on around 20 percent of their body weight. Some also perform elaborate courtship dances, forming pair bonds that may last for life.

About a fifth of the last wild migratory flock of 300-some whooping cranes also stop here along their spring and fall migrations.

But over the years, dams have transformed the habitat the cranes once occupied. A majority of the birds now squeeze into just 20 or so miles of prime habitat along the river between Kearney and Grand Island, Neb., but around four times that much was all prime years ago.

“The spectacle we see of all of these birds packed into one area is really an indication of a river in peril,” Mr. Taddicken said.

If you want to see the cranes in great numbers, the best time to go is in the morning when they fly out from the river to eat, or the evening, when they fly back to roost on sandbars. The land that offers the best views is mostly private, so you will have to book a tour: Rowe Sanctuary and Crane Trust have some. In Major Defeat for Trump, Push to Repeal Health Law Fails House Republican leaders, facing a revolt among conservatives and moderates in their ranks, pulled legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act from consideration on the House floor Friday in a major defeat for President Trump on the first legislative showdown of his presidency.

“We’re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,” the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, conceded.

The failure of the Republicans’ three-month blitz to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement exposed deep divisions in the Republican Party that the election of a Republican president could not mask. It cast a long shadow over the ambitious agenda that Mr. Trump and Republican leaders had promised to enact once their party assumed power at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.

And it was the biggest defeat of Mr. Trump’s young presidency, which has suffered many. His travel ban has been blocked by the courts. Allegations of questionable ties to the Russian government forced out his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Tensions with key allies such as Germany, Britain and Australia are high, and Mr. Trump’s approval ratings are at historic lows.

Republican leaders were willing to tolerate Mr. Trump’s foibles with the promise that he would sign into law their conservative agenda. The collective defeat of the health care effort could strain that tolerance.

Mr. Trump, in a telephone interview moments after the bill was pulled, tried to put the most flattering light on it. “The best thing that could happen is exactly what happened — watch,” he said.

“Obamacare unfortunately will explode,” Mr. Trump said later. “It’s going to have a very bad year.” At some point, he said, after another round of big premium increases, “Democrats will come to us and say, ‘Look, let’s get together and get a great health care bill or plan that’s really great for the people of our country.’”

Mr. Trump expressed weariness with the effort, though its failure took a fraction of the time that Democrats devoted to enacting the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. “It’s enough already,” the president said.

A major reason for the bill’s demise was the opposition of members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which wanted more aggressive steps to lower insurance costs and to dismantle federal regulation of insurance products.

In a day of high drama, Mr. Ryan rushed to the White House shortly after noon on Friday to tell Mr. Trump he did not have the votes for a repeal bill that had been promised for seven years — since Mr. Obama signed the landmark health care law. During a 3 p.m. phone call, the two men decided to withdraw the bill rather than watch its defeat on the House floor.

Mr. Trump later told journalists in the Oval Office that Republicans were 10 to 15 votes short of what they needed to pass the repeal bill.

The effort to win passage had been relentless, and hardly hidden. Vice President Mike Pence and Tom Price, the health secretary, visited Capitol Hill on Friday for a late appeal to House conservatives, but their pleas fell on deaf ears.

Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, said, “We are going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,” after Republicans decided to pull the bill repealing Obamacare in a blow to President Trump.

“You can’t pretend and say this is a win for us,” said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, who conceded it was a “good moment” for Democrats.

“Probably that champagne that wasn’t popped back in November may be utilized this evening,” Mr. Walker said.

At 3:30 p.m. on Friday, Mr. Ryan called Republicans into a closed-door meeting to deliver the news that the bill would be withdrawn, with no plans to try again. The meeting lasted five minutes. One of the architects of the House bill, Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, put it bluntly: “This bill’s done.”

“We are going to focus on other issues at this point,” he said.

The Republican bill would have repealed tax penalties for people without health insurance, rolled back federal insurance standards, reduced subsidies for the purchase of private insurance and set new limits on spending for Medicaid, the federal-state program that covers more than 70 million low-income people. The bill would have repealed hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act and would also have cut off federal funds to Planned Parenthood for one year.

Mr. Ryan had said the bill included “huge conservative wins.” But it never won over conservatives who wanted a more thorough eradication of the Affordable Care Act. Nor did it have the backing of more moderate Republicans who were anxiously aware of the Congressional Budget Office’s assessment that the bill would leave 24 million more Americans without insurance in 2024, compared with the number who would be uninsured under the current law.

The budget office also warned that in the short run, the Republicans’ legislation would drive insurance premiums higher. For older Americans approaching retirement, the cost of insurance could have risen sharply.

With the House’s most hard-line conservatives holding fast against the bill, support for the legislation collapsed Friday after more and more Republicans came out in opposition. They included Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, the soft-spoken chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and Barbara Comstock of Virginia, whose suburban Washington district went for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, in November.

“Seven years after enactment of Obamacare, I wanted to support legislation that made positive changes to rescue health care in America,” Mr. Frelinghuysen said. “Unfortunately, the legislation before the House today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey.”

The bill died after Republican leaders, in a bid for conservative support, agreed to eliminate federal standards for the minimum benefits that must be provided by certain health insurance policies.

“It’s so cartoonishly malicious that I can picture someone twirling their mustache as they drafted it in their secret Capitol lair last night,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. “Republicans are killing the requirements that insurance plans cover essential health benefits” such as emergency services, maternity care, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and prescription drugs.

Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for the bill’s defeat, and they proudly accepted responsibility.

“Let’s just, for a moment, breathe a sigh of relief for the American people that the Affordable Care Act was not repealed,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.

Defeat of the bill could be a catalyst if it forces Republicans and Democrats to work together to improve the Affordable Care Act, which members of both parties say needs repair. Democrats have been saying for weeks that they want to work with Republicans on such changes, but first, they said, Republicans must abandon their drive to repeal the law.

“Obamacare is the law of the land,” Mr. Ryan said. “It’s going to remain the law of the land until it’s replaced.”

Whatever success Mr. Trump had in making business deals, he utterly failed in his first effort at cutting a deal at the pinnacle of power in Washington, Democrats said.

“This is not the art of the deal,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, alluding to Mr. Trump’s best-selling book. “It is the art of the steal, of taking away insurance coverage from families that really need it to provide tax breaks for those at the very top.”

Rejection of the repeal bill may prompt Republicans to reconsider the political strategy they were planning to use for the next few years.

“We have to do some soul-searching internally to determine whether or not we are even capable of functioning as a governing body,” said Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota. “If ‘no’ is your goal, it’s the easiest goal in the world to reach.”

Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina, offered this advice to hard-line conservatives who helped sink the bill: “Follow the example of Ronald Reagan. He was a master; he built consensus. He would say, ‘I’ll take 80 percent and come back for the other 20 percent later.’”

Failure of the House effort leaves the Affordable Care Act in place, with all the features Republicans detest.

“We tried our hardest,” said Representative Michael C. Burgess of Texas, chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health. “There were people who were not interested in solving the problem. They win today.”

“The Freedom Caucus wins,” he added. “They get Obamacare forever.” North Carolina School System Pulls Book About a Boy in a Dress. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system in North Carolina was going to use a book about a boy who likes to wear dresses as part of a first-grade lesson on what to do when someone is bullied.

But school administrators this week pulled the book, “Jacob’s New Dress,” after critics complained about its content.

The book came under fire from the North Carolina Values Coalition, a conservative group that promotes “pro-family positions,” according to its website.

Tami Fitzgerald, the executive director of the coalition, said that no notice was given to parents about the book and that it was sprung on teachers only days before it was supposed to be used.

“I read the book online,” she said. “It’s clearly geared to young children. The book is meant as a tool of indoctrination to normalize transgender behavior. I think a lot of parents would object to that.”

She said a teacher tipped off the coalition, which emailed its members, issued a news release and was organizing a petition when the school system reversed course.

“We believe the purpose of first grade is to teach writing, reading and math and not to teach boys to wear dresses,” she said.

The book opens with Jacob in the dress-up corner of a classroom where students can put on costumes and imagine themselves in different roles. Jacob puts on a sparkly pink dress and a crown and declares, “I’ll be the princess.”

A classmate complains that Jacob likes to wear girl clothes, but Jacob’s parents and his teacher are nonjudgmental and supportive. Jacob and his mother make a dress that he proudly wears to school. His father says, “Well, it’s not what I would wear, but you look great.”

The school system’s superintendent, Ann Clark, said in a statement that the system had planned to use the book as part of an “age-appropriate lesson” for Child Abuse Prevention Month.

The lesson was intended to help students recognize harassment and bullying and teach them what to do if it happens, she said. “The initial first-grade book selection, which focuses on valuing uniqueness and difference, has been replaced due to some concerns about the book,” she said.

Instead, the school system said, the book “Red: A Crayon’s Story,” about a blue Crayon with a red label, will be used.

The decision about the book came one year after North Carolina was the target of lawsuits, economic boycotts and intense criticism for legislation known as House Bill 2. The legislation curbs legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and requires transgender people in public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. An effort in December to repeal the legislation failed.

Ian and Sarah Hoffman, the authors of “Jacob’s New Dress,” wrote in the book that when their son Sam was in preschool “he had long hair, wore dresses, and loved the color pink.” He also liked “traditional ‘boy’ things like knights, castles and dinosaurs,” they wrote, adding that he was “gender nonconforming; we liked to call him a pink boy — the male equivalent of a tomboy.”

In an email, Mr. Hoffman rejected the notion that the book was a way to indoctrinate young people. The suggestion “that a book can turn someone gay, or transgender, or anything else is bizarre,” he wrote.

“If a white kid reads a book about Martin Luther King, is that kid going to become black?” he continued. “If a ballerina reads a book about football, is that going to make her try out for the N.F.L.?”

He wrote that the Jacob is a boy who likes things that do not adhere to typical gender roles. He compared it to how a girl wearing pants would have been viewed 100 years ago.

The reaction to the book has been overwhelmingly positive, he wrote, adding that the only other negative feedback happened in 2015 in Lancaster, Pa. Some parents were angry that they were not notified before it was read to a kindergarten class.

“What the North Carolina backlash tells us is that our book is needed,” he wrote. “Our hope, when we wrote this book, was that some day it would be considered quaint. We imagined future generations saying, ‘What was the fuss about?’ Clearly, there’s more work to do.” California Today: Henry Rollins Strikes Chord as a Columnist. Good morning.

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)

At 56, Henry Rollins is still angry.

When he was a younger man, the rage flowed out of him as the scowling frontman for Black Flag, the pioneering Southern California punk band.

Today, Mr. Rollins may no longer scream to get his point across. But as a spoken word performer, radio host and, notably, a widely read columnist at LA Weekly, he has reinvented himself as a political voice that is similarly hard to ignore.

“It’s definitely one of the most popular regular features that we run,” his editor at LA Weekly, Andy Hermann, said of his writing. “He’s just a great commentator and satirist.” (Here are a couple of pieces that Mr. Hermann said struck a big chord with readers.)

We caught up with Mr. Rollins by phone. Some excerpts from the conversation:

Q. What’s your approach to the column?

A. As far as political writing, to use the baseball idea, if you can’t hit them where they ain’t and score, then — basically don’t be obvious.

And if you’re going to make a point, if you can’t bring some humor into it — I mean obviously someone getting shot and killed in Ferguson, Mo., there’s no fun there. But anything with Donald Trump, where there’s so much to say, if you don’t bring some humor in, it’s going to be unreadable.

Q. Have you mellowed with age?

A. Not really. I’ve just been able to prioritize and direct my energies with a little bit more care and aim, where I don’t need to scorch the entire forest because I’m angry. I can just pick out the three trees and that turns into a column or that turns into something on stage.

Q. You’ve said you cultivate your anger. Why?

A. Because it turns into good things.

I saw the HBO documentary on the West Memphis Three and I said, ‘Oh, O.K. you’ve officially pissed me off. Arkansas we’re coming for you.’ And it was out of anger. I was concerned for guys in jail, yeah, but it was anger that got my civic muscle going. And I started calling rich, famous people I knew — ‘Hey can I have a thousand dollars [to donate to a legal fund]?’ I couldn’t believe it. I was like a member of Congress dialing for dollars.

Q. Do you ever think about making music again?

A. No. For me it was a real time and place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was never fun. It was necessary. I really had to say those words. But I never enjoyed it and I’ll be the first to admit I was never all that good at it. But it was real.

Santa Monica firefighters worked to revive a dog, Nalu, after pulling him from a burning apartment on Tuesday. Billy Fernando
It wasn’t looking good for Nalu.

The small, floppy-eared dog inhaled a lot of smoke after a fire erupted at a Santa Monica apartment on Tuesday. The fire was quickly put out. Nalu, a 10-year-old bichon frise-shih tzu mix, was limp and not breathing.

“He was essentially dead,” said Andrew Klein, the firefighter who pulled the dog from the burning home.

Mr. Klein set Nalu on the grass and began delivering oxygen with a specialized pet mask and performing mouth-to-snout resuscitation.

Minutes passed. Nothing.



Crystal Lamirande, the dog’s owner, was distraught as Andrew Klein administered oxygen to the animal. Billy Fernando
Kneeling nearby, the dog’s owner, Crystal Lamirande, who had been running errands when the blaze broke out, was distraught.

She put her hand on the dog’s belly. “Come on Nalu,” she said.

Then, an improbable 20 minutes after efforts to revive him began, Nalu blinked and, slowly, his chest rose.

Ms. Lamirande, 35, a nurse, had just lost her home. Yet for the moment she was elated.

“She couldn’t stop saying, ‘Thank you,’” said Billy Fernando, a passer-by who watched the drama.



After about 20 minutes, Nalu was revived. Ms. Lamirande embraced the dog. Billy Fernando
Speaking by phone Thursday, Ms. Lamirande said Nalu was back to his old self. “He’s so lovely. People just love him,” she said.

Ms. Lamirande said she lost sentimental objects in the fire, whose origin was unknown.

But she was coping, she added, “It’s just stuff.”
• It’s now or never, Trump tells G.O.P.

Calling for a vote today in the House, President Trump sent a blunt message to Republicans in Congress: Support the bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, or leave former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement in place.

The ultimatum came after Speaker Paul Ryan postponed an initial vote on the measure, which appeared to lack a majority to pass.

The uncertainty over the bill’s prospects leaves the president, who prides himself on his ability to make deals, facing a rare instance of self-doubt.

Back Story

Goodyear, the U.S.-based tire multinational, retired the last of its blimps this month. But the replacements, semirigid dirigibles, will also be called blimps.

“Because a Goodyear Semirigid Dirigible doesn’t roll off the tongue,” Eddie Ogden, the company’s airship historian, said about sticking with the term.


Workers gathered under the “Spirit of Innovation,” the last of Goodyear’s blimps, as they began its decommissioning in Carson, Calif., this month. Mike Blake/Reuters
The essential difference between a blimp and the semirigid dirigible lies in the internal frame: When the helium is let out of the dirigible, it maintains its shape, unlike the blimp.

As the helium was let out of the last blimp from the original fleet, Spirit of Innovation, in Los Angeles recently, the Goodyear employees watching the deflation let out some emotion, too.

“There were a couple tears because they’ve been working with blimps for so long,” Mr. Ogden said.

Spirit of Innovation was the first Goodyear blimp to be named by the public, in a contest won by Matthew Harrelson, a high-school teacher, in 2006.

“It was easy to connect Goodyear and innovation,” Mr. Harrelson said. “And then ‘spirit’ just seemed to make the name flow better.”

Before the contest, the blimps were named after the winners of the America’s Cup yacht race. The former chairman of Goodyear, P. W. Litchfield, started the practice in 1928 because he envisioned blimps as aerial yachts.

Around the world, about 20 to 25 of these “aerial advertising yachts” are still operating, according to one blimp company. Part of the allure of social media is telling friends and strangers what’s happening in your life.

Post. Tweet. Share. Repeat.

But suppose you are worried that you have revealed too much and want to protect your privacy. You can delete your social media accounts and try to cover up your digital footprints — but be warned: The process can be laborious and is not always foolproof.

Why are you leaving?

Experts cautioned against trying to erase every trace of yourself from the internet.

Rather than obliterating your social media presence, clean it up by deleting or deactivating dormant accounts, said Amy A. Lavin, a professor of management information systems at Temple University.

Lavin said that she had recently deleted her Myspace account because it was years old, probably had a “supersimple” password, and she wanted to reduce the risk that someone might take photos from her profile and use them against her.

“I think it’s a matter of being as responsible about your social media presence as your personal presence,” she said. “What is it you want people to see and know about you?”

Bruce R. Mendelsohn, a digital marketing and social media consultant, recommended staying on LinkedIn, the professional networking site. If potential employers cannot find you there, they may wonder what you are hiding, he said.

“Not being on social media raises questions about legitimacy, popularity and hipness,” he said.

Also consider your motives for wanting to disappear, Robert Siciliano, chief executive of IDTheftSecurity.com, said in an email. Are you a private person who doesn’t want the world to know your personal information? Or do you feel threatened somehow?

How to delete your accounts

Sites such as accountkiller.com, deseat.me and justdelete.me link you to pages where you can delete your profiles and they provide step-by-step instructions and useful tips.

Mr. Mendelsohn suggested a “nuclear option” — deleting your accounts entirely on the “Big Four”: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google Plus — or a “limited strike” of deleting selected posts by or about you.

Gone but not forgotten

“Whenever you’re deleting a social media profile, it’s important to check whether the process actually deletes your profile or simply deactivates it,” Henry Carter, a professor of computing sciences at Villanova University, said in an email.

Even when you close an account, some sites might retain your data and keep an “inactive” version of your profile posted should you decide to return, he wrote.

You might be able to remove content you created, but it will be impossible to stop others from posting about you, said Allison Matherly, digital engagement coordinator at Texas Tech University. “In the long run, removing 100 percent of references to yourself from social media is highly improbable,” she wrote in an email.

Don’t forget other sites

While Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram may be your most frequent stops online, don’t overlook other platforms such as dating sites, blogs, Flickr, eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, PayPal and support forums.

“We often only think of the social media channels we are currently using, when we have actually been online and using social media or similar forms of two-way online communication for much longer than we think,” Ms. Matherly wrote.

What do you stand to lose?

Disappearing from the web can mean losing any marketing presence you’ve established, Mr. Siciliano said. You also may be unable to restart an eliminated account with the same name or email address.

And unplugging from social media can mean losing touch with family and friends “in an age when the letter and even the phone call are not used as often,” Ms. Matherly said.

“Many people find communities of others similar to them, and take solace and thrive from interactions with those individuals regularly,” she added.

What do you stand to gain?

Get rid of social media and you will have more time to do other things, Mr. Mendelsohn said. “It’s the whole FOMO thing — fear of missing out,” he said. “You’re going to relieve yourself of a lot of anxiety.”

John DeSanto, 65, of Warwick, N.Y., shut down his Facebook account in January after having it for about six years. When he was on Facebook, he went out of his way to do things that he could post so he could show off to his friends, “possibly creating a persona that may not have been completely accurate,” he said in an email.

Mr. DeSanto said he deleted his account because a relative was attacking his friends over politics. After quitting Facebook, he missed it for about two weeks, he said, but now it’s like it never existed.

The internet and social media have provided platforms where “everybody’s unintelligent ideas are flying in circles like mosquitoes around the digital campfire,” he wrote. “So now, in the world of online commenting, it’s all stupidity, all the time.” C.I.A. Developed Tools to Spy on Mac Computers, WikiLeaks Disclosure Shows. SAN FRANCISCO — The C.I.A. developed tools to spy on Mac computers by injecting software into the chips that control the computers’ fundamental operations, according to the latest cache of classified government documents published on Thursday by WikiLeaks.

Apple said in a statement Thursday evening that its preliminary assessment of the leaked information indicated that the Mac vulnerabilities described in the disclosure were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013.

However, the documents also indicated that the Central Intelligence Agency was developing a new version of one tool last year to work with current software.

The leaked documents were the second batch recently released by WikiLeaks, which said it obtained a hoard of information on the agency’s cyberweapons programs from a former government worker or contractor. The first group of documents, published March 7, suggested that the C.I.A. had found ways to hack Apple iPhones and Android smartphones, Microsoft Windows computers, Cisco routers and Samsung smart televisions.

Since the initial release of the C.I.A. documents, which the agency has not confirmed are authentic, major technology companies have been scrambling to assess whether the security holes exploited by the C.I.A. still exist and to patch them if they do.

All of the surveillance tools that have been disclosed were designed to be installed on individual phones or computers. But the effects could be much wider. Cisco Systems, for example, warned customers this week that many of its popular routers, the backbone of computer networks, could be hacked using the C.I.A.’s techniques.

Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has offered to share the precise software code used by the C.I.A.’s cyberweapons with the affected companies. But major tech companies have been reluctant to directly engage with him for fear of violating American laws governing the receipt of classified information.

At a news conference Thursday, Mr. Assange criticized the government policies that restricted such communications but said that Apple had nonetheless been willing to work with representatives of his anti-secrecy organization. Trump Hotel in Washington Does Not Violate Lease, U.S. Says.  The Trump Organization scored a major victory on Thursday when the agency in charge of overseeing federal government property ruled that its Trump International Hotel in a historic government building on Pennsylvania Avenue did not violate the terms of its lease when Donald J. Trump became president.

“The tenant is in full compliance,” Kevin M. Terry, a contracting officer at the agency, the General Services Administration, wrote in a 166-page ruling.

The decision came after Democrats in Congress and several government contracting experts and ethics groups had questioned if language in the 2013 lease between the G.S.A. and Mr. Trump and three of his children prohibited an elected federal official from participating in the deal.

“No member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom,” the lease says, referring to the Old Post Office building, which the Trump Organization converted into the hotel late last year.

After the election, Mr. Trump resigned from his executive positions at the Trump Organization and turned over management of its enterprises to his two oldest sons, as well as to other executives who work at Trump Tower in New York. He also put his assets in a trust controlled by his sons, and made himself the ultimate beneficiary of the trust.

To further address the concerns related to the lease, the Trump Organization agreed this week that during Mr. Trump’s White House tenure it would not distribute proceeds from the Washington hotel to his trust. The agreement also says no proceeds will go “to any other entity in which President Trump has a direct, indirect or beneficial interest,” meaning he would not profit from its operations in any way.

The Trump Organization, in a statement on Thursday, praised the ruling, which Mr. Trump’s son Eric Trump, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, predicted in an interview last month.

“We would like to thank the G.S.A. for their diligent review of this matter,” the statement said. “We are immensely proud of this property and look forward to providing our guests with an unrivaled luxury experience for years to come.”

Mr. Terry of the G.S.A. wrote in an eight-page decision memo, backed up by 158 pages of other documents and exhibits, that the Trump Organization had invested $200 million in the Old Post Office, which was decrepit before the deal. He also noted that at the time the hotel opened late last year, the government had already been paid $5.1 million in rent.

Mr. Terry said that the Old Post Office’s “historic integrity has been restored, and the wasting asset is now being put to productive use.”

The ruling was criticized by ethics watchdog groups and certain House Democrats, who pointed out that with Mr. Trump in control of the federal government, he in effect controls the General Services Administration.

The agency “changed the position it held before President Trump took office,” Representatives Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Peter DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, said in a statement. “This decision allows profits to be reinvested back into the hotel so Donald Trump can reap the financial benefits when he leaves the White House. This is exactly what the lease provision was supposed to prevent.”

The G.S.A. ruling does not put the issue away. Mr. Trump is being sued by a restaurant in Washington, the Cork Wine Bar, which says that it has lost business as a result of an illegal advantage the hotel holds from its association with Mr. Trump. (The hotel contains several restaurants.)

Steven L. Schooner, a former federal government contracting officer and a lawyer who is helping represent the restaurant owners, said that even with the ruling, the conflict of interest still existed, as Mr. Trump was both the landlord, in essence, and the tenant.

“The contracting officers’ decision favors the president, who, in effect, is his supervisor,” said Mr. Schooner, who is also a professor specializing in federal procurement law at George Washington University. “We want the public to have confidence in the integrity of the government, and this smacks of cronyism.”

The hotel has also become a target of criticism because, after Mr. Trump’s election, it marketed itself to foreign government officials, urging them to hold their events there.

Critics have suggested that Mr. Trump might be violating a provision in the Constitution that bars federal officials from taking payments or gifts from foreign governments, and he is being sued over the provision in federal court.

Mr. Trump has said that he intends to donate to the United States Treasury any profits at his hotels from foreign government payments.

Google and Microsoft, he said, had simply pointed WikiLeaks to its existing channels for anyone to report a security flaw.

In its statement, Apple denied negotiating with WikiLeaks. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms,” the company said. “Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain. We are tireless defenders of our users’ security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.”

The spy software described in the latest documents was designed to be injected into a Mac’s firmware, a type of software preloaded in the computer’s chips. It would then act as a “listening post,” broadcasting the user’s activities to the C.I.A. whenever the machine was connected to the internet.

A similar tool called NightSkies was developed in 2009 to spy on iPhones, the documents said, with the agency figuring out how to install it undetected before a new phone was turned on for the first time. (Apple said that flaw affected only the iPhone 3G and was fixed in all later models.)

Although most of the tools targeted outdated versions of the Apple devices’ software, the C.I.A.’s general approach raises new security concerns for the industry, said Eric Ahlm, who studies cybersecurity at Gartner, a research firm. By rewriting the most basic software of a computer or a phone, tools that operate at the chip level can hide their existence and avoid being wiped out by routine software updates.

Under an agreement struck during the Obama administration, intelligence agencies were supposed to share their knowledge of most security vulnerabilities with tech companies so they could be fixed. The C.I.A. documents suggest that some key vulnerabilities were kept secret for the government’s use.

The C.I.A. declined to comment Thursday, pointing reporters to its earlier statement about the leaks, in which it defended its use of “innovative, cutting-edge” techniques to protect the country from foreign threats and criticized WikiLeaks for sharing information that could help the country’s enemies. Duncan Hunter Under Criminal Investigation for Ethics Violations. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into a California congressman who faces allegations that he spent tens of thousands of dollars in campaign funds on family trips to Hawaii and Italy, private school tuition and dance competitions for his children, and even video games, officials disclosed Thursday.

Representative Duncan D. Hunter, a Republican from San Diego who was considered for several top national security posts in President Trump’s administration, became the latest in a string of at least eight current or former members of Congress to face criminal investigations over ethics issues in the last several years.

A five-term congressman, Mr. Hunter has already paid back $60,000 to his political campaign to correct what he said were mistaken payments for personal items.

But that has not cleared him of scrutiny.

The House Ethics Committee, which has been examining Mr. Hunter’s possible misuse of campaign funds, said in a statement on Thursday that it would put its review on hold at the request of the Justice Department.

Typically, the Justice Department asks the ethics committee to hold off on a review because it has opened a criminal investigation of its own. A person with knowledge of the case said prosecutors have notified Mr. Hunter of their criminal investigation.

“Congressman Hunter intends to cooperate fully with the government on this investigation, and maintains that to the extent any mistakes were made they were strictly inadvertent and unintentional,” said Mr. Hunter’s lawyers, Elliot S. Berke and Gregory A. Vega.

The lawyers said that Mr. Hunter learned of the possible ethics issues last year and “out of an abundance of caution, he took corrective action,” by repaying about $60,000.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the case on Thursday.

Mr. Hunter’s Democratic opponent in last year’s election tried to make the mounting reports of the congressman’s legal problems a campaign issue. But Mr. Hunter easily won re-election.

Mr. Hunter, first elected in 2008 to take his father’s seat, was an early congressional supporter of Mr. Trump’s long-shot bid for president.

As a former Marine in Iraq and Afghanistan who now sits on the House Armed Services Committee, he was seen as a possible choice for defense secretary or another top job in the Trump administration. He told The San Diego Union-Tribune days after Mr. Trump’s election that he wanted to restore “a warrior culture, a warrior mentality” to the government.

A confidential referral to the ethics committee by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which was made public on Thursday, detailed the wide scope of his possible campaign violations.

Mr. Hunter “may have converted tens of thousands of dollars of campaign funds from his congressional campaign committee to personal use to pay for family travel, flights, utilities, health care, school uniforms and tuition, jewelry, groceries, and other goods, services, and expenses,” said the ethics office, an independent body that House Republicans tried to shut down in January.

A watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, brought a complaint with the ethics office last April charging that Mr. Hunter’s campaign spending included family trips to Italy and Hawaii, consulting fees to his wife, payments to his children’s parochial school and $1,300 for video games that he said his teenage son mistakenly charged to a credit card.

Noah Bookbinder, the group’s director, said Mr. Hunter “has shown a blatant disregard for the rules.” He called the case “the most egregious congressional spending scandal since Aaron Schock,” referring to the former Republican congressman from Illinois who gained infamy for decorating his House office in an ornate manner inspired by “Downton Abbey.” Mr. Schock was indicted by the Justice Department last November on 24 criminal counts and has pleaded not guilty. Rex Tillerson Tells Embassies to Increase Scrutiny on Visas.

Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson sent cables to American embassies around the world directing consular officials to impose further screening on people applying for visas to enter the United States. Trump Administration Orders Tougher Screening of Visa Applicants. The Trump administration is making it tougher for millions of visitors to enter the United States by demanding new security checks before giving visas to tourists, business travelers and relatives of American residents.

Diplomatic cables sent last week from Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson to all American embassies instructed consular officials to broadly increase scrutiny. It was the first evidence of the “extreme vetting” Mr. Trump promised during the presidential campaign.

The new rules generally do not apply to citizens of 38 countries — including most of Europe and longstanding allies like Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea — who can be speedily admitted into the United States under the visa waiver program. That program does not cover citizens from any country in the Middle East or Africa.

Even stricter security checks for people from six predominantly Muslim nations remain on hold because federal courts have temporarily blocked President Trump’s travel ban.

But Mr. Trump and his national security team are not waiting to toughen the rules to decide who can enter the United States. Embassy officials must now scrutinize a broader pool of visa applicants to determine if they pose security risks to the United States, according to four cables sent between March 10 and March 17.

That extra scrutiny will include asking applicants detailed questions about their background and making mandatory checks of social media history if a person has ever been in territory controlled by the Islamic State.

Mr. Trump has spoken regularly of his concern about the threat of “radical Islamic terrorism” from immigrants. But it is unclear who, exactly, will be targeted for the extra scrutiny since Mr. Tillerson’s cables leave that decision up to security officers at each embassy.

Still, taken together, consular officials and immigration advocates said the administration’s moves will increase the likelihood of denial for those seeking to come to America, and will further slow down a bureaucratic approval process that can already take months or even years for those flagged for extra investigation. In 2016, the United States issued more than 10 million visas.

There are legitimate reasons someone might be targeted, such as evidence of a connection to terrorism or crime. But advocates also said they worry about people being profiled for extra scrutiny because of their name or nationality.

“This will certainly slow down the screening process and impose a substantial burden on these applicants,” said Greg Chen, the director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “It will make it much harder and create substantial delays.”

The cables from Mr. Tillerson, which were reported by Reuters, make clear that the Trump administration wants a more intense focus on the potential for a serious threat when making decisions about who should receive a visa.

“Consular officers should not hesitate to refuse any case presenting security concerns,” Mr. Tillerson wrote in the cables, titled “Implementing Immediate Heightened Screening and Vetting of Visa Applications.”

“All visa decisions are national security decisions,” the secretary of state added.

During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Obama administration of failing to properly screen people coming into the United States, a claim former officials in that administration reject. As a candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to ban all incoming Muslims until leaders could “figure out what the hell is going on.” Later, he backed away from a total ban on Muslims but promised “extreme vetting” of those trying to come to the United States.

The president’s first attempt to put tougher screening in place was the executive order aimed at temporarily blocking refugees and people whom Mr. Trump called “bad dudes” from predominantly Muslim countries. Courts blocked the first version of the president’s order after a chaotic rollout just days into his term. A second order was blocked this month.

But on March 6, the same day that Mr. Trump issued his revised travel ban, he also wrote a presidential memorandum ordering the secretary of state, the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security to “implement protocols and procedures” to enhance visa screening.

Administration officials said the cables from Mr. Tillerson are among the actions being taken to carry out that memorandum. Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said the steps aim “to more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the United States.”

Most people seeking entry to the United States, for family, business or tourism reasons, must apply for a visa. Embassy officials can deny a visa for anyone suspected of being a threat, conducting fraud or planning to stay longer than allowed.

The seven-page unclassified cable that Mr. Tillerson sent on March 15, which was provided to The New York Times, makes clear that the process of securing an entry visa is about to get harder and longer at diplomatic posts around the globe.

“Consular chiefs must immediately convene post’s law enforcement and intelligence community partners” to develop what Mr. Tillerson described in the cable as “sets of post-applicant populations warranting increased scrutiny.”

People targeted for increased scrutiny, Mr. Tillerson said in his cable, may be subject to a decision made only after more rigorous screening.

The March 15 cable suggests areas of inquiry during a required interview, including: the applicant’s travel history, addresses and work history for 15 years; and all phone numbers, email addresses and social media handles used by the applicant in the past five years.

Another cable, sent two days later, indicated that consular officers should not begin asking for the 15-year travel and work histories until the State Department received authorization for those questions from the Office of Management and Budget. It is unclear why that permission had not been granted.

The State Department also urged its embassy officials to delay or reschedule interviews if an applicant was unable to provide all of the information demanded. And Mr. Tillerson acknowledged in the cables that the extra scrutiny would cause “backlogs to rise,” even as he recommended that officials should each interview no more than 120 visa applicants each day.

Mr. Chen, of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, questioned how a single interviewer who conducts 120 interviews per day — at about five minutes per interview — could improve security for the visa process.

“It’s highly unlikely they could obtain information that demonstrates whether someone is a national security threat in such a brief interview process,” he said.

In addition to the new security protocols for embassies, the four diplomatic cables sent last week offer a view into how the administration hopes to enact the travel ban if the president ever gets the chance.

The March 15 cable, which was sent before federal courts blocked the revised travel ban, increases scrutiny on people from the six countries in the president’s executive order: Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Somalia and Libya. It also includes a section calling for increased scrutiny for Iraqi nationals.

For those from the six countries covered in the ban, the cable envisions a process for potentially granting a limited number of exemptions from the ban by issuing a waiver, but only after vigorous screening. Those people would be questioned about their past 15 years of travel and occupational history, as well as whether they have visited territory controlled by the Islamic State.

 In the other major fight on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats signaled a willingness to filibuster Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch.

Democrats Plan to Filibuster to Thwart Gorsuch Nomination. Senate Democrats on Thursday vowed to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nominee’s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber.

As committee hearings on Judge Gorsuch concluded on Thursday, it appeared increasingly likely that Republicans hoping to elevate President Trump’s choice for the court would resort to replacing longstanding rules with a simple majority vote on his confirmation.

While a parade of witnesses addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, trading dueling views of Judge Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, went to the Senate floor and announced that he would try to lead Democrats in blocking an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch. The Senate’s “cloture” rule requires a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome such a filibuster.

“After careful deliberation I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court,” Mr. Schumer said, citing concerns over Judge Gorsuch’s record on workers’ rights and his degree of independence, adding, “My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.”

Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster — a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions.

If Democrats band together, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has threatened to pursue the so-called nuclear option eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court selections. Mr. Trump has urged Mr. McConnell to take that step if necessary.

Some Republicans have expressed reservations about changing the rules, but Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Thursday that he would relent if it meant seating Judge Gorsuch. “Whatever it takes to get him on the court, I will do,” Mr. Graham told “The Mike Gallagher Show” radio program.

Mr. McConnell has said he wants the Senate to confirm Judge Gorsuch to fill the vacancy, which was created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia more than a year ago, before departing for a scheduled recess on April 7. Last year, Mr. McConnell led his party in refusing to consider President Obama’s choice for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland, during a presidential election campaign.

On Thursday, Mr. McConnell accused Democrats of engaging in “obstructionist tactics” to block a well-qualified nominee.

“Despite the judge’s outstanding performance, his exceptional background, and the extensive support he’s received from people of all political leanings, we know that some Senate Democrats will continue trying to come up with any reason to delay the confirmation process,” Mr. McConnell said of Judge Gorsuch.

During the four days of hearings, even Judge Gorsuch’s critics did not dispute his credentials. On Thursday, representatives of the American Bar Association told the committee that it had unanimously found Judge Gorsuch to be “well qualified,” the group’s highest rating. That was particularly notable in light of studies that have shown the group has tended to favor the nominees of Democratic presidents.

“We do not give the ‘well qualified’ rating lightly,” said Nancy Scott Degan, an official of the bar association.

The group had also given its highest rating to Judge Garland. Since the evening Judge Gorsuch was nominated, liberal groups have been pressuring Democrats to filibuster the vote on him.

Four years ago, when Democrats controlled the Senate and Republican senators were blockading Mr. Obama’s appeals court and executive branch nominees, Democrats changed the chamber’s rules to bar filibusters for such positions — but left the filibuster rule in place for Supreme Court nominations.

Republicans have cited this history often in accusing their colleagues of hypocrisy on Judge Gorsuch.

To eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, Republicans would need to vote in virtual lock step: The party effectively has only 51 votes right now because one member, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, is recuperating from back surgery, so just two Republican senators could block a rules change.

Still, Judge Gorsuch’s nomination is broadly popular among conservatives. The question facing Democrats is whether to have a filibuster fight over Judge Gorsuch, highlighting what they consider the theft of a seat they believe Mr. Obama had a right to fill, or whether to save that attention-grabbing tactic for a hypothetical future vacancy if a more liberal justice dies or steps down and President Trump nominates a staunch conservative who would shift the court’s balance.

“I don’t think we should move forward on the Gorsuch nomination until the nomination of Merrick Garland has been dealt with fairly,” Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said on Thursday, signaling his support for a filibuster.

Another moderate Democrat, Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, also said he would reject Judge Gorsuch and join the filibuster effort. Mr. Casey is among the 10 Democrats facing re-election next year in states that Mr. Trump won.

Others in the group were less eager to declare their intentions.

“I’m going to keep on my theme I’ve been on for a couple of months,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. “I’m not going to talk about Gorsuch.”

Even before Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, Ms. McCaskill inadvertently drew the ire of liberal activists by expressing support for “a full confirmation hearing process and a vote,” before making clear she believed in a 60-vote threshold.

Despite the escalating political friction, the atmosphere in the hearing room on Thursday was often more perfunctory than passionate, as panels of witnesses selected by Democrats and Republicans alternately expressed concerns that Judge Gorsuch was too conservative or praised him as a well-qualified and careful judge.

Two of Judge Gorsuch’s former colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver — Deanell Reece Tacha, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and Robert Harlan Henry, appointed by President Bill Clinton — praised his intellect and temperament.

But others expressed concerns. One strain of criticism came from human rights and civil liberties activists, who expressed alarm over Judge Gorsuch’s experiences as a Justice Department official in the Bush administration in 2005 and 2006, when he helped to defend and advance the executive branch’s positions on matters like detainee treatment and surveillance.

Jameel Jaffer, who litigated national-security cases against the government as the former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, urged the committee to scrutinize more closely Judge Gorsuch’s views on executive power and individual rights.

Mr. Jaffer pointed to documents showing, for example, that Judge Gorsuch had worked to get Congress to enact a law stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear lawsuits by Guantánamo Bay detainees, and in one email chain he criticized law firms that helped represent prisoners in seeking judicial review of their detention.

On Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch told the committee that the email had not been “my finest moment” and that he had been “blowing off steam with a friend, privately.” Of the 860,000 Nebraskans who cast ballots in last fall’s election, only two are suspected of casting fraudulent votes. But while the actual number of illegal voters may be minuscule, State Senator John Murante says, there is an even better reason for Nebraska’s Legislature to crack down on fraud at the ballot box.

“First and foremost, we know the confidence that Americans and Nebraskans have in the election system is at an all-time low,” said Mr. Murante, a Republican who is backing a constitutional amendment that would require all voters to display photo IDs. “The perception exists that voter fraud is a serious issue, and that perception itself has to be addressed.”

Nationwide, Republican state legislators are again sponsoring a sheaf of bills tightening requirements to register and to vote. And while they have traditionally argued that such laws are needed to police rampant voter fraud — a claim most experts call unfounded — some are now saying the perception of fraud, real or otherwise, is an equally serious problem, if not worse.

Given Republicans’ history of raising undocumented claims of fraud, Democrats and voting rights advocates say that citing perceptions of tainted ballots as a reason for voting restrictions is disingenuous at best.

“It seems strange that someone who created the problem of perception then says we have to solve the problem, when there is no problem,” said Lloyd Leonard, the advocacy director for the League of Women Voters, which has sued to block a number of restrictive voting laws.

In states across the country, Republicans are echoing the Nebraska argument for anti-fraud measures.

“It is true that there isn’t widespread voter fraud,” said State Representative Ken Rizer, who steered a bill requiring voters to display IDs through the Iowa House of Representatives this month. “But there is a perception that the system can be cheated. That’s one of the reasons for doing this.”

In Arkansas, State Representative Mark Lowery said his voter ID bill aimed to prevent fraud. But even more important, he added, is that “a large percentage of Americans do not trust the integrity of the electoral system, and that in and of itself is a problem that needs to be solved, because that undermines the basic tenet of democracy.”

There is history to this, said Allegra Chapman, the director of voting and elections at the advocacy group Common Cause. The first Supreme Court ruling to support voter ID laws, in an Indiana case called Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, acknowledged in 2008 that there was zero evidence of voter fraud in the state. But as long as the law inconvenienced everyone equally, it could be legal — even if it deterred “significant numbers” of voters from voting — if it had a “sufficiently weighty” justification. Trust in elections met that standard, the court added, because confidence could be low “if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud.”

As real-world evidence of the laws’ impact on minorities has snowballed, the Crawford decision has come under growing criticism. Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit — a highly regarded conservative — wrote the 2007 decision on Crawford that the Supreme Court upheld. But by 2014 he had recanted, issuing a blistering dissent in a Wisconsin voter ID case that called ID laws a “fig leaf” for disenfranchising citizens, and specifically rejecting the claim that bolstering voters’ confidence justified them.

Ms. Chapman said she suspected that the perception argument was a political talking point devised in the wake of several federal court rulings last year that the laws discriminated against Democratic-leaning minorities.

“They’re being clever,” she said. “They’re trying to find some legitimate grounds for which to have these laws pass muster.”

After the Supreme Court handed victory in the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush, furious Democrats called the vote deeply flawed. Since then, dubious charges of fraud have become a staple of Republican crusades for laws tightening the rules for registering and casting votes. Those charges reached a new peak when President Trump railed against “rigged” elections while a candidate and claimed without any evidence that he would have won the popular vote but for millions of illegal votes cast against him.



Voters in North Carolina had to show a photo ID before casting their ballots in November. Travis Dove for The New York Times
Faith in the electoral process has markedly declined since 2000, surveys show. One poll, released in October, concluded that barely four in 10 Americans had great confidence in an accurate vote count.

Voter fraud does happen, of course, sometimes in striking fashion. A former chairman of Colorado’s Republican Party, a radio talk-show host who stated on the air in October that “virtually every case of voter fraud I can remember in my lifetime was committed by Democrats,” was charged this month with voter fraud. The former chairman, Steve Curtis, was accused of filling out a ballot addressed to his ex-wife, who lives in South Carolina.

But voting rights advocates say that widespread fraud is a myth, and that most restrictions are created to keep Democratic-leaning minorities and young adults away from the polls. Judges lately have agreed; last year, federal courts ruled that voter ID laws in Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin and North Dakota discriminated against minorities.

Many academic studies conclude that anti-fraud laws depress turnout. But the conclusion is not unanimous; this month, researchers at Stanford, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania took issue with one such study concluding that voter ID laws depress Democratic voter turnout far more than Republican turnout. The researchers evaluated the same data used in the study and found “no apparent relationship” between the laws and turnout.

In the wake of Republican claims, bills have been filed in at least 27 state legislatures to stiffen rules or document requirements for registering and voting, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. At least 16 have proposed new or revised voter ID laws; many more are tightening requirements to register.

Iowa’s voter ID bill, which appears headed for passage in the State Senate, is typical of many, requiring voters to display a driver’s license or non-operator’s license, a military or veteran identification card or a passport. Voters lacking those documents would be able to vote after signing an oath attesting to their identity.

“We are not without fraud,” said Mr. Rizer, who noted that 41 disenfranchised felons cast ballots in November (all but five were discovered before being counted). Critics, including the state’s local election officials, say undetected fraud at the polls is so minuscule that it does not merit re-identifying voters who already proved their identity when they registered.

Among other states, New Hampshire is close to approving legislation to stiffen residency requirements for new voters, including a written warning that law enforcement officers may visit voters’ homes to verify residency. Mr. Trump was able to provide no documentation for a widely derided claim that Massachusetts residents were bused into New Hampshire to cast illegal ballots that contributed to his defeat there.

“Nobody’s saying there’s evidence of widespread fraud,” said Regina Birdsell, a Republican state senator and the bill’s sponsor. “But our voter laws are so broad you could drive a Mack truck through them.”

She added, “There is a perception, as far as I am concerned, that the laws need to be tightened up.”

The Arkansas legislature has already voted to place a constitutional amendment on the state’s 2018 ballot that would require voters to display IDs.

Mr. Lowery’s bill takes a different tack; it would put in place the ID requirement more quickly and without a ballot initiative. Unlike many such bills, his takes an expansive view of acceptable identification — from public-assistance IDs to employee badges to student identification cards. Voters without IDs can cast ballots if they swear they are who they say they are.

“We’re trying to give them every chance,” he said, “but we want them to vouch for their identity.”
Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of a House panel investigating Russian interference in the presidential election, may have dealt his own inquiry a fatal blow on Wednesday.

Armed with intelligence that some Republicans said bolstered President Trump’s widely disputed claim of being wiretapped by the Obama administration, Mr. Nunes bypassed Democrats and went directly to the White House. The new information, Mr. Nunes said, showed that American intelligence agencies monitoring foreign officials may have “incidentally” picked up communications of Trump transition team members.

The move angered Democrats who said that Mr. Nunes’s attempt to buttress Mr. Trump’s accusation raised questions about his ability to conduct an impartial bipartisan investigation.

The House Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, issued a challenge, saying that Mr. Nunes had to decide whether he was chairman of an independent investigation or “is going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both.”

Mr. Nunes apologized on Thursday to committee members for sharing new information with Mr. Trump and the news media before communicating with Mr. Schiff, according to two Democrats on the committee.

Mr. Nunes described his decision as a judgment call. “At the end of the day, sometimes you make the right decision, sometimes you make the wrong one,” Mr. Nunes told reporters on Thursday. “But you’ve got to stick by the decisions you make.”

With the House investigation in question, Democrats will be forced to rely on an inquiry being led by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also controlled by Republicans. Ideally, Democrats want a independent commission created to investigate the matter. The White House vehemently opposes that idea and Republican lawmakers have dismissed it as unnecessary.

Here is where things stand, and how they may play out.

A House Inquiry Built on Trust

The House investigation has hinged on the mutual trust of its senior members, Mr. Nunes and Mr. Schiff.

Despite pursuing distinctly different goals — Mr. Schiff has been focused on Russian interference in the election while Mr. Nunes has railed against leaks of classified information — they united around a shared interest in conducting a credible, bipartisan investigation.

But expectations for their investigation plummeted Wednesday as Mr. Schiff questioned the independence of Mr. Nunes, a former member of Mr. Trump’s transition team.

“It was my hope that our investigation could be conducted properly,” Mr. Schiff said. “It’s still my hope that this investigation should be conducted properly, but unfortunately the actions of the chair throw that very much in doubt.”

The committee’s Democrats have moved carefully so far, concerned that pushing too hard, too soon, to subpoena witnesses or documents like Mr. Trump’s tax returns would rile Republicans. They even praised Mr. Nunes’s openness to their requests, an indication that they had no incentive to scuttle their chances of advancing a serious investigation by scoring political points.

Attention Shifts to Senate Democrats

With confidence in the House investigation undermined, there is increased pressure on the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia.

Since January, Mr. Warner has tried to work with the committee’s chairman, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, to investigate the links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Warner would likely need Mr. Burr’s support to issue a subpoena in order to maintain the bipartisan nature of the investigation.

Last month, that relationship appeared to deteriorate after it was reported that both Mr. Burr and Mr. Nunes had helped the administration push back on news stories about links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia.

The Democratic leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, publicly scolded Mr. Burr, saying that he was “very disappointed.” The Republican’s behavior, Mr. Schumer said, “certainly gives the appearance, if not the reality, of a lack of impartiality.”

That rebuke aside, there is not much the Democrats can do to punish Mr. Burr. The committee’s first public hearing since the F.B.I. director disclosed that the bureau was investigating links between Trump campaign officials and Russia is scheduled for next week.

In coming weeks, the Senate committee would need to issue subpoenas to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for documents related to the inquiry. If Mr. Burr declines to issue them, Democrats would likely portray that as a Republican refusal to conduct an independent investigation, and accelerate demands for an outside commission.

Calls for an Independent Commission

Since shortly after the election, Democrats have pushed for the creation of an independent inquiry similar to the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, or the commission formed after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, has introduced legislation to form the commission.

Under Mr. Swalwell’s proposal, Congress would appoint 12 members to investigate whether there was interference in the election, who was behind it and how it could be prevented in the future. The members of the commission would be pulled from a pool of former senior national security, law enforcement and election officials who are respected by both parties.

Among the type of officials who could be appointed to such a panel are Robert M. Gates, the former secretary of defense under President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush; Colin Powell, the former secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Robert S. Mueller, the F.B.I. director under Presidents Bush and Obama. The commission would have a full-time investigative staff and the power to review classified information, subpoena witnesses and issue a public report.

Democrats had toyed with the idea of asking for the creation of a select committee that would be made up just of members of Congress — similar to the committee that investigated the 2012 attacks on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

The Benghazi probe became highly politicized, and another select committee to investigate the election would likely turn just as partisan.

Republicans Dismiss Need For a Commission

For an independent commission to be created, legislation must be approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the president.

Congress can override a presidential veto. But, so far, Republicans who control the House and Senate have said they see no reason for such a body to be created when an investigation can be handled by the intelligence committees. Democrats have privately said that to pressure Republicans into creating such a commission likely would take some type of significant disclosure — like publicly released evidence of direct collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.

Mr. Swalwell said that he has met with Lee Hamilton — the vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission and a former Democratic congressman from Indiana — about how to win Republican support for an independent body to investigate the election.

Mr. Hamilton told Mr. Swalwell to drop the word “Russia” from the name of the commission to show Republicans that there would be no predetermined beliefs about what had occurred. Mr. Swalwell followed that advice, proposing that the inquiry be named the “National Commission on Foreign Interference in the 2016 Election.”

“He told me to do everything we could in how we wrote the bill to make Republicans comfortable as they can be to come on board,” Mr. Swalwell said.

Every House Democrat is a co-sponsor of the measure. Just one House Republican has joined up. Thomas Painter has one of the coolest jobs in science.

A hydrologist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology, Dr. Painter leads the Airborne Snow Observatory, a mapping project in the Sierra Nevada. Using an instrument-bearing airplane, his team has been generating the most detailed understanding of the amount of snow blanketing the Sierra Nevada.

This morning, we published a collection of interactive maps and photos based on the group’s work that illustrate the astonishing amount of snow that has accumulated in the mountains this year.

Immigration agents made an arrest in Los Angeles. John Moore/Getty Images
On Monday, we wrote about immigration agents identifying themselves as “police” during enforcement operations in Los Angeles and asked you to offer your thoughts.

To recap, city leaders say the practice threatens the long nurtured trust of unauthorized immigrants that they can interact with the Los Angeles Police Department without fear of deportation.

On Wednesday, I asked Miguel Unzueta, a former special agent in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego, why immigration agents use the term “police” in the field.

The goal, he said, is to be quickly identified as law enforcement, and in a sketchy situation, you don’t want to create confusion with unfamiliar acronyms.

“You’re going to say, ‘Police with a warrant,’ as opposed to ‘I.C.E. with a warrant’ or ‘H.S.I. with a warrant,’” he said, referring to Homeland Security Investigations. “So it’s really more of an officer safety issue.”

An overwhelming majority of readers who wrote in did not see it that way. Those who opposed the practice outnumbered those who approved of it by a margin of roughly 25 to one. Many called it misleading.

A small number of readers said the dictionary definition of “police” applies to immigration agents, who should be free to use it.

During commercial breaks in “Fox & Friends” and “Saturday Night Live” this month, a peculiar advertisement has flashed across television screens in New York, Washington and West Palm Beach, Fla.

In what seems like a parody of a Billy Mays OxiClean commercial, a smiling salesman wielding a white bucket peddles a product he promises will cause the cost of cars, food, clothing and medicine to soar: “The all new BAT tax is specially designed to make your disposable income disappear!”

Airing in those locations and during those programs, the ad is clearly meant for the eyes of President Trump. But its creator, the National Retail Federation, wants it to influence Republicans in Congress and voters, too.

That’s because the BAT the salesman promotes is the “border adjustment tax” — the keystone of the plan to overhaul the tax code being pitched by House Republicans and spearheaded by Speaker Paul D. Ryan. The commercial is the first strike in what is becoming an outright ad war, the harbinger of a bigger battle over tax policy that may make the current fight over health legislation look tame. The sums spent on television and digital media ads are expected to dwarf what has been spent on the health care fight so far because rewriting the tax code creates such a broad array of corporate winners and losers.

“There is going to be a lot more of this because tax is the next big thing up after the Supreme Court and health care,” said Evan Tracey, senior vice president of National Media Research, Planning & Placement, a Republican media firm. “Right now everybody is trying to get their arguments out there in a public setting.” The twist now, he said, is that “the president is someone that is believed to be reachable through cable TV ads.”

While Republican lawmakers are struggling to keep their health care bill alive, groups including the retail lobby, Tea Party Nation, the Club for Growth and the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch are mobilizing to kill the border adjustment tax, which would levy a 20 percent tax on imports. Should they succeed, it would effectively send the blueprint for the first tax overhaul in 30 years back to the drafting table.

The debate echoes the way the health care legislation is playing out, with Republicans in the House pushing a bold plan, Senate Republicans expressing skepticism and the Trump administration sending mixed signals as the anxiety about big policy changes swirls.

“This is part of an education campaign for lawmakers,” David French, the senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, said of his group’s advertising campaign. “We think there is an element of absurdity to passing the buck to consumers.”

Even in its infancy, the concept of a new import tax has divided lawmakers in the capital and business executives across the country. The National Retail Federation got a forceful response this week from the American Made Coalition, a group of mostly export-heavy industrial companies that support the tax plan. It unveiled a TV ad of its own selling the potential for a boom in manufacturing jobs if the import tax becomes law.

“This is an opening salvo,” said John Gentzel, a spokesman for the American Made Coalition, which is running its ad on cable television in Washington. “We’re going to continue to push.”

Trade groups and lobbyists of all stripes are stocking their war chests for a long slog. Mr. Gentzel said his group had spent in the “six-figure” range on its advertising. The coalition of hundreds of companies led by the retail group is preparing a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign that will ramp up once the tax overhaul takes center stage. It is also running ads on local newspaper websites around the country and making an aggressive push on social media.

The Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group that promotes free markets, has also jumped in. Taking on the party it usually supports, it has been running ads opposing the import tax in the districts of Republican lawmakers who sit on the House tax-writing committee. Its commercial riffs on the game show “The Price Is Right.”


Another ad against the import tax takes its inspiration from the game show "The Price Is Right." Club for Growth
Judson Phillips, the founder of Tea Party Nation, unveiled an online ad this week titled “Deplorables Against the Consumer Tax.” It plays up the notion that the plan would hit the wallets of Mr. Trump’s working-class supporters.

The ad resembles a “Harry and Louise” advertisement from the 1990s that helped doom President Bill Clinton’s health care overhaul. This time, a couple at their dining room table lament the higher costs of groceries and gas from an import tax and wonder why Republicans sold them out.

“I don’t know why they’ve gotten this idea in their head,” Mr. Phillips said of his fellow Republicans in an interview. He warned that tax legislation that raises costs on consumers will hurt the party in 2018. “That is going to be a hanging curveball for Democrats. They will beat the living daylights out of Republicans.”

The most notable opposition may come from the Koch brothers, whose business and political arms are traditionally eager to back Republican causes. That has not been the case with the health care legislation or the tax overhaul. They do not like the border tax. “We think in the long term it would hurt the country and us as well,” said Philip Ellender, the president of government and public affairs at Koch Companies Public Sector L.L.C.

The company has not yet advertised its position on television, but it has commissioned studies that show the House Republican plan would slow economic growth by placing a burden on consumers. “This is our number one issue right now,” Mr. Ellender said.

No one thinks it is too early to start lobbying. “It would be good for our tax position,” Amy Campbell, the director of investor relations at Caterpillar, explained at an industry conference last week. As a net exporter, the company supports the border adjustment tax. “This is the time to get tax reform in place,” she said.

Small-business owners without the resources to advertise are making their concerns known in other ways. Rick Woldenberg, the chairman of Learning Resources, an educational toy company that relies heavily on imports, has started a blog through which he rails against the border adjustment tax.

Despite the sense that Mr. Trump may end up dousing the idea, Mr. Woldenberg traveled last week to Capitol Hill from Chicago to make his case to House and Senate staff members. He said he would not let up until Mr. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, changed their plan. “We’re all zombies if this thing goes forward,” Mr. Woldenberg said.

But it does not appear that Mr. Brady will give up on the plan. He has described the border tax as the only way forward. In an interview on CNBC on Tuesday, he predicted that doubters would eventually see the light.

“My sense is that border adjustability has become a given,” Mr. Brady said, “that it will be part of the final tax reform plan.” The story that Wendy Lavarnia told the police on Monday was horrifying: Her 2-year-old son had grabbed a loaded 9-millimeter handgun off a bed while her back was turned, pointed it at his 9-year-old brother and pulled the trigger. That is how her son Landen was shot in the head, she said. At home alone with her four children, she called the police right away.

But the police now say that questions abound about the fatal shooting — including who shot the boy and whether it was an accident. On Tuesday, Ms. Lavarnia, 28, and her husband, Kansas Lavarnia, 31, were charged with first-degree murder in Arizona in connection with Landen’s death, the police announced Wednesday. He died at a Phoenix hospital on Tuesday afternoon, a day after he was shot.

The charges against Landen’s parents, the police said, are based on the great lengths the authorities believe the Lavarnias took to clean up the scene of the shooting — including the trunk of Mr. Lavarnia’s vehicle — before seeking help. Sgt. Vincent C. Lewis of the Phoenix Police Department told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday that the parents’ extensive destruction of evidence had delayed critical and potentially lifesaving care.

“Significant efforts were made to scrub the house clean and remove evidence while this young boy lay shot and dying,” Jeri L. Williams, the department’s chief, said at the news conference. “This investigation will continue while justice is brought about.”

Sergeant Lewis said the authorities were still investigating who pulled the trigger on the gun that killed Landen, as well as how much time his parents allowed to pass before they called 911. They are also investigating what role, if any, the 2-year-old may have played.

Had Mrs. Lavarnia changed what she had told the police on Monday?

“I am not aware of that,” Sergeant Lewis said. He was among the officers who responded to the scene on Monday, and said that Mrs. Lavarnia had been “stoic” as she described the shooting of her oldest child.

The role of Mr. Lavarnia was still unclear Wednesday. His wife said that he was not home during the shooting, and Sergeant Lewis said that Mr. Lavarnia arrived at the house three hours after police officers began their investigation.

But evidence indicates that he had helped clean up the crime scene, the police said on Wednesday, and when he got to the house on Monday he had a fresh gunshot wound on his arm.

The wound was “suspicious,” Sergeant Lewis said, and had been “loosely packed with makeshift first aid materials” that were also found inside his vehicle. "Manual puncture wounds” surrounded Mr. Lavarnia’s gunshot wound, “as if perhaps to conceal it,” the sergeant said. He declined to elaborate on what those puncture wounds may have been.

The sergeant said the police were investigating how Mr. Lavarnia was shot. He declined to say whether the same handgun had been used to shoot both Mr. Lavarnia and his son.

The Lavarnias were arrested on Monday night on lesser charges. Mrs. Lavarnia was charged with child abuse for leaving her children near a loaded and unsecured handgun. Mr. Lavarnia, a felon, was charged with unpermitted possession of a firearm. While in custody they were charged with first-degree murder and hindering prosecution, he said.

It was unclear on Wednesday evening if the couple had lawyers representing them.

The Lavarnias have two other children, a 4-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl. The police said their three surviving children are in the care of the Arizona Department of Child Safety.

The parents remain in jail and are both being held on a $1 million bond. More than 20 prisoners were shackled and packed tightly on a privately operated bus as it zigzagged from Wisconsin to Georgia this month. The men and women were being extradited to faraway jurisdictions where they had open arrest warrants or pending criminal cases, and some had been traveling for more than 10 days as the bus picked up and dropped off prisoners.

Bathroom stops were infrequent, several prisoners said, so the passengers urinated in bottles and defecated on the floor. The heat failed, and they huddled together for warmth as temperatures dropped to freezing. The conditions were so deplorable that at one point, they all scribbled down their contact information on a fast-food wrapper, hoping to reconnect later to sue the owner of the bus, Prisoner Transportation Services, the nation’s largest for-profit extradition company.

But shortly after Kevin Eli added his name to the list, near Columbus, Ga., he was dead.

Mr. Eli, 29, was being transported from Virginia to Florida to face a nine-year-old charge of stealing a pearl necklace during a burglary. His death on March 7 was at least the fifth on a P.T.S. vehicle in five years. Eight months earlier, Loretta Lynch, then the attorney general, had told a congressional committee that her office would investigate for-profit extradition companies after reporting by the Marshall Project and The New York Times revealed a pattern of deaths and abuse in the industry.

Since 2000, another two dozen people have been killed or seriously injured in more than 50 crashes on private vehicles operated by these businesses, while at least 60 prisoners have escaped and 14 others have alleged sexual assault on board.

State correction departments and countless local law enforcement agencies hire extradition companies to retrieve fugitives and suspects. Vans or buses travel long, circuitous routes, sometimes for weeks, with little sleep for guards or prisoners. Because they cross so many jurisdictions, oversight falls into a gray zone. Companies are governed by a 2000 federal law known as Jeanna’s Act, which set broad standards for the treatment of prisoners but has been enforced only once.

Seven prisoners on the bus, all interviewed independently, said Mr. Eli’s troubles started when he got into an altercation with another prisoner on board. As punishment, the guards, who were employees of P.T.S. and its subsidiaries, U.S. Prisoner Transport and U.S. Corrections, cuffed his wrists behind his back.

Then, as he began to complain of chest pain and repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe,” they put him in a segregation cage, prisoners said.

Mr. Eli, of Queens, pleaded with the guards to call 911 for 20 minutes to half an hour, prisoners said. But the guards accused him of faking his distress and said the bus must keep moving toward its next destination, the other prisoners said.

“I watched that man beg for his life,” said Ronald Snavley, 47, whose extradition from Indiana to Florida to face a drunken-driving charge took two weeks, including a stop at a jail that serves as a hub for P.T.S. Other prisoners said they had screamed for help as Mr. Eli eventually fell unconscious and made groaning sounds, his eyes fixated and his skin discolored. A guard tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate him by performing CPR, they said.

A lawyer representing P.T.S., Alex Little, said in an emailed statement that the company had opened an internal investigation into Mr. Eli’s death. “P.T.S. is continuing to cooperate with the applicable authorities,” he said. “As a result of the pending investigations and ongoing autopsy, P.T.S. cannot make any further comment at this time.” Mr. Little declined to answer questions about the alleged conditions on the bus.

In November, P.T.S. officials said they had begun to make a number of safety improvements, including more frequent breaks for drivers, new cameras and seatbelts in vehicles, and increased medical oversight by employees. “We trained them on how to be more aware of inmates in distress,” said Joel Brasfield, the company’s president. He said he would not tolerate inhumane conditions.

Yet the passengers who witnessed Mr. Eli’s crisis described a ride as filthy and dangerous as ever.

Prisoners were not able to brush their teeth or shower for the entire journey, they said, and the bathroom on board was unusable. Women menstruating had to make tampons out of McDonald’s wrappers, in front of the male prisoners, and urinate in plastic bottles with the tops cut off. Wires could be seen dangling out of at least one camera, and no one had seatbelts. Shackled, they banged around as the bus careened along at high speeds, sometimes crossing the median and knocking into road signs.

Theresa Wigley, who has diabetes, was being transported from Wisconsin to Florida to face a charge of improperly using a company credit card. She said that during her two-week journey, she was given her medication intermittently and fed only fast food; she vomited repeatedly.

“We all knew that what we were going through was an unacceptable, inhumane thing that should not be happening in the United States of America,” Ms. Wigley, 54, said, explaining why the prisoners had shared their phone numbers and social media identities on the scrap of hamburger wrapper and entrusted the list to Tyisha Anthony, a prisoner who said she was planning a career in the law.

Before climbing aboard the bus, Mr. Eli had served six months at the Rappahannock Regional Jail in Stafford, Va., for violating his probation on a 2012 shoplifting conviction. The Broward County, Fla., sheriff’s office then hired U.S. Corrections to bring him to Florida at a price of $981 for the 991 miles of transport, an invoice shows.

Mr. Eli died of unknown causes after 11 days in transit, as the bus passed through Fort Benning, a military base on the Alabama-Georgia border.

Christopher Grey, a spokesman for the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command, said the military police had responded to an emergency call at about 10 p.m. He said C.I.D. did not suspect foul play. Mr. Grey and an Army spokesman declined to answer further questions, citing an ongoing investigation.

The prisoners said they had been relieved to see police cars pulling up to the bus at Fort Benning and had assumed they would be interviewed. But they said they were not questioned, and shortly after Mr. Eli’s lifeless form was taken off the vehicle, they were driven to a jail in a neighboring county. They stayed there for 12 hours, officials at that jail confirmed, before continuing the journey.

Mr. Eli’s family members said they were notified of his death on March 10.

His mother, Tina, sobbing throughout an interview, said the family had paid several thousand dollars to have his body shipped back to the New York area. She said she had not been told who, if anyone, would investigate her son’s death.

She described her son as a playful and generous man who, as a child, had dreamed of becoming a police officer. He had called her last month to ask for his favorite meal — strudel and stuffed cabbage — when he finally made it home.

“My baby is dead!” she cried. “So what do I have now? I have nothing!”

A spokesman for the Justice Department wrote in an email that the agency takes seriously all allegations of prisoner abuse and neglect and is committed to enforcing the law.

Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, who questioned Ms. Lynch last summer as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said Monday that he planned to renew his inquiry by writing to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and calling for a subcommittee hearing on the deaths and abuses aboard private extradition vans.

“What’s so appalling is that there’s more care shown to furniture being delivered across state lines in this country than there is to humans,” he said. In a police shooting case that tests when people can sue law enforcement officers, Supreme Court justices on Wednesday argued sharply different views of whether improper actions by officers expose them to liability for what follows.

In 2010, while looking for a wanted man, Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies did not have a warrant when they illegally searched a house and a small shack behind it. Two deputies entered the shack without knocking or announcing themselves, saw what they said was a man holding a rifle — it turned out to be a BB gun — and opened fire. They wounded the man and his pregnant girlfriend, neither of whom was the person they were looking for.

Angel Mendez, who lost his right leg below the knee in the shooting and lived in the shack with Jennifer Lynn Garcia, sued the county in federal court and won $4 million in damages. The county appealed.

The legal question in the case, County of Los Angeles v. Mendez, is not about the shooting itself; the courts have agreed that at the moment they pulled their triggers, the deputies could have reasonably believed they were in danger. Instead, the argument has turned on whether the warrantless search, a violation of constitutional rights, was the “proximate cause” that made the deputies liable for the shooting, or if it was merely a contributing factor.

“It doesn’t seem to me a fluky or random thing to say, when there’s an unauthorized entry into someone’s home, violence may result,” Justice Elena Kagan said. She likened an officer without a warrant to a trespasser, who would meet a very different response than would a guest.

But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. disagreed strongly. “If you take away the failure to get a warrant, the harm still occurs,” he said. “The search warrant is not going to change the conduct.”

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy voiced seemingly conflicting views. Without liability, “we simply have no way to enforce the warrant requirement,” he said. But calling the lack of a warrant the proximate cause of the shooting, he said, is “a difficult position to defend.”

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against Los Angeles County partly based on a theory that officers who recklessly provoke a confrontation can be liable for the results. Legal analysts expect that reasoning, which other appellate courts have not adopted, to be addressed in the Supreme Court’s decision. But it was barely discussed on Wednesday.

The deputies’ failure to warn before entering the shack could be deemed improper, and was more directly linked to the shooting. But the Ninth Circuit ruled that it was not clear in 2010 that the “knock and announce” rule the courts have espoused would apply to a building like a shack.

Using that rule to support the plaintiffs, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., said, “You end up imposing liability for what is arguably a violation of best police practices.”

But Justice Stephen G. Breyer questioned the need to break the incident down moment by moment to find liability. “The background circumstances can be such that there is no justification for the whole ball of wax,” he said. Leaders Struggle to Unite House Republicans Behind Health Bill. The House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act faced an uncertain fate on Wednesday as conservative Republicans pushed to eliminate federal requirements that health insurance plans provide certain benefits to consumers.

House Republican leaders met with members of their party late into the night on Wednesday as they struggled to muster support for the bill, scheduled for a vote on the House floor on Thursday.

President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, worked through the day to placate conservative House Republicans who said that the bill did not do enough to lower health insurance costs by reducing federal regulations. The legislation would roll back major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a significantpillar of President Barack Obama’s legacy.

But in trying to satisfy conservatives, the Trump administration and House Republican leaders risked jeopardizing support for the bill among more moderate Republicans. On the eve of the crucial vote, party leaders appeared to be short of a majority and were working into the night to whip their members into line.

Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, expressed optimism on Wednesday night that talks with Republican leaders would lead to revisions to the bill.

“We’re encouraged tonight, just based on the real willingness of not only the White House, but our leadership, to make this bill better,” Mr. Meadows said, crediting the personal involvement of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence.

But Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania and a leader of a moderate bloc of lawmakers known as the Tuesday Group, said late Wednesday night that he would oppose the bill.

“I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for low-to-moderate income and older individuals,” Mr. Dent said.

And the powerful conservative network funded by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch issued a direct challenge to the president and said that it would provide financial support to members who voted against the plan.

“We will stand with lawmakers who keep their promise and oppose this legislation,” said James Davis, executive vice president of Freedom Partners, the umbrella organization responsible for the Koch brothers’ political efforts.

About two dozen conservative Republicans, including Freedom Caucus members, met Wednesday with top administration officials, including Mr. Pence and Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump.

“I don’t think they changed any minds,” Representative Randy Weber, Republican of Texas, said after the meeting.

The tenacity and persistence of the conservatives appeared to give them outsize influence as Mr. Ryan struggled to round up votes for the repeal bill, which faces solid opposition from House Democrats. Supporters of their bill have put their faith in Mr. Trump, whose young presidency could be badly damaged by a public and consequential loss.

“When the president calls someone and says, ‘I need your vote on this,’ it’s very hard to say no to the president of the United States when this torpedoes our entire conference, Trump’s entire presidency, and we end up losing the Senate next year and we lose members in the House,” said Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and a top Trump supporter in the House.

But conservative opposition was over substance, not politics. Conservatives are upset over the failure of the House bill to repeal a set of regulations in Mr. Obama’s signature health law, which require insurers to cover a base set of benefits, like maternity care, preventive services, wellness checkups and rehabilitative services. These “essential health benefits” raise the cost of insurance and prevent companies from offering stripped-down options, the conservatives say.

“How can you talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, without repealing the essential health benefits?” asked Representative Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican who attended the meeting with Mr. Pence.

Republican leaders say that if the House makes such changes to the bill, it could imperil their ability to push the legislation through the Senate using expedited procedures that neutralize the threat of a filibuster.

Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho, likened the swirling cloud of uncertainty to the situation in November 2003, when the House approved a bill adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare after a roll-call vote that lasted nearly three hours in the middle of the night. The bill passed, 220 to 215, after House Republican leaders put down a conservative rebellion.

“It’s tough to pass controversial things, especially when Republicans have different ideas,” Mr. Simpson said. Eventually, he predicted, House leaders will get the votes they need, though they may need to tweak the repeal bill.

Representative Scott DesJarlais, Republican of Tennessee, said the administration tried to sell the House bill, known as the American Health Care Act, by arguing that it could be improved later in the Senate. But House members rarely relish handing their political fate to the other chamber.

“I am more skeptical,” Mr. DesJarlais said. “I like to see what I’m going to get when I vote for it, not promises that I get later.”

Asked if supporters of the bill had the votes to pass it in the House, Mr. DesJarlais said, “I don’t think they do.”

A spokeswoman for the Freedom Caucus, Alyssa Farah, said that more than 25 members of the caucus were “no” votes on the health care measure — enough to sink the bill in the House, though that count could not be independently verified.

Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, said that despite recent changes to the health care bill, he was unable to vote for it.

“This legislation simply won’t lower premiums as much as the American people need, and lowering the cost of coverage is my primary goal,” said Mr. Harris, an anesthesiologist and member of the Freedom Caucus.

House leaders were also contending with opposition from more moderate Republicans worried about the toll that the health bill could take in their districts. Representative Dan Donovan of New York, who attended a meeting at the White House with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, said Wednesday that he would vote against the bill.

“Recognizing that the status quo is failing isn’t, on its own, a compelling reason to vote ‘yes’ on the current replacement plan,” said Mr. Donovan, the only Republican House member from New York City. In his final day of questioning at his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch continued to answer with practiced generalities on Wednesday, frustrating Democrats who seemed unable to rattle him or pin him down.

“You have been very much able to avoid any specificity like no one I have seen before,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “And maybe that’s a virtue, I don’t know. But for us on this side, knowing where you stand on major questions of the day is really important to a vote.”

Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said he was searching to find “a beating heart and an independent streak” behind Judge Gorsuch’s testimony.

After trying over a span of 20 hours over two days, Democrats were not able to move Judge Gorsuch off script. Instead, interest in the hearing seemed to wane, and many in the Capitol came to view a confirmation as inevitable.

Judge Gorsuch managed to endure as much by what he did not say as by what he did.

Most Supreme Court nominees are fairly reticent, but Democrats said Judge Gorsuch outdid the last two Republican appointees, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. They gave their views on seminal Supreme Court decisions, said Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.

“We’ve had justices nominated by Republican presidents who have been willing to discuss past precedent,” Mr. Leahy said. “I was just kind of hoping you would be as transparent as these prior nominees were.”

The Supreme Court gave Senate Democrats a small gift on Wednesday, issuing a unanimous decision in a case on students with disabilities that rejected the approach Judge Gorsuch had taken in a different case.

The relationship between the two decisions was indirect, and Judge Gorsuch said he had merely followed precedent. But Democrats welcomed the opportunity to elicit answers from Judge Gorsuch about a specific Supreme Court decision, and they returned to the topic repeatedly.

At other points, senators probed Judge Gorsuch’s general judicial philosophy, notably his commitment to originalism, which tries to interpret the Constitution consistently with the understanding of those who drafted and adopted it.

“It’s selective originalism,” Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said of the nominee’s approach, accusing him of relying on “nonoriginalist judges to get to the outcome” in some preferred cases.

In a speech last year, Judge Gorsuch said judges should “apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be — not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.”

Ms. Feinstein asked where that approach left women and gays given the understanding of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause when it was ratified in 1868. Judge Gorsuch responded that he would respect precedents providing for constitutional protections for those and other groups. He later said he would do so even if the precedents had not themselves used an originalist approach to interpreting the Constitution.

Judge Gorsuch added that the intentions of those who adopted the amendment were irrelevant.

“It matters not a whit that some of the drafters of the 14th Amendment were racists,” he said. “Because they were. Or sexists, because they were. The law they drafted promises equal protection of the laws to all persons. That’s what they wrote.”

“No one is looking to return us to horse and buggy days,” he said. Later, he added, “Backward doesn’t mean backwards.”

Even attempts to saddle Judge Gorsuch with President Trump’s baggage, including the president’s attacks on the judiciary, yielded little. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, suggested that his Democratic colleagues were being hypocritical, citing their own criticisms of Judge Gorsuch.

“It’s a little rich for them to be maligning a sitting federal judge,” Mr. Cruz said, “and at the same time giving speeches about how unacceptable it is for anyone to criticize a federal judge.”

The closest Judge Gorsuch came to embracing Mr. Trump was perhaps the inadvertent deployment of a curious adverb — “bigly” — often associated with the president. (Mr. Trump has said he is merely saying “big league.”)

“I just won five bucks,” Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, told the judge.

More often, Democrats sought to draw attention to bigger money in politics.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, argued that just as agencies could sometimes be captive to the industries they regulate, there was a danger that the Supreme Court could be captured by business interests.

“Nobody will capture me,” Judge Gorsuch responded.

Ms. Feinstein pressed Judge Gorsuch about a document concerning torture from his time as a senior Justice Department official in 2005 and 2006. It was a set of questions about the C.I.A. program, including: “Have the aggressive interrogation techniques employed by the administration yielded any valuable intelligence? Have they ever stopped a terrorist incident? Examples?” In the margin next to this, Judge Gorsuch had scribbled, “Yes.”

Ms. Feinstein, who was the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee when it conducted an investigation into the Bush-era torture program that concluded otherwise — asked Judge Gorsuch what information he had received that led him to write “yes.”

He replied: “My recollection of 12 years ago is that that was the position that the clients were telling us. I was a lawyer. My job was as an advocate, and we were dealing with the detainee litigation. That was my job.”

Democratic senators, who had tried largely in vain to find a line of attack that sticks against Judge Gorsuch, appeared to sense an opening of sorts in Wednesday’s Supreme Court decision.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, quickly declared his intention to make an issue of the ruling.

“President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, was unanimously rebuked today by the Supreme Court,” Mr. Schumer said, saying the case reinforced “a continued, troubling pattern of Judge Gorsuch deciding against everyday Americans — even children who require special assistance at school.”

George Weinberg Dies at 87; Coined ‘Homophobia’ After Seeing Fear of Gays.
George Weinberg, a psychotherapist who, in the mid-1960s, observed the discomfort that some of his colleagues exhibited around gay men and women and invented a word to describe it — homophobia — died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 87.

His wife, Dianne Rowe, said the cause was cancer.

Dr. Weinberg was preparing to speak before the East Coast Homophile Organization in 1965 when he began thinking about a recent incident. A group of colleagues, learning that a friend he was bringing to a party was a lesbian, asked that he disinvite her. He sensed not just dislike, he said, but also fear — a fear so extreme that it suggested some of the characteristics of a phobia.

“I coined the word homophobia to mean it was a phobia about homosexuals,” Dr. Weinberg told Gregory M. Herek, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, in 1998. “It was a fear of homosexuals which seemed to be associated with a fear of contagion, a fear of reducing the things one fought for — home and family. It was a religious fear, and it had led to great brutality, as fear always does.”

Dr. Weinberg discussed his ideas with the gay activists Jack Nichols and Lige Clarke, who used the new term in a column they wrote for Screw magazine on May 5, 1969, discussing the fear felt by straight men that they might be gay. It was the word’s first appearance in print.

A few months later, Time magazine used “homophobia” in a cover article, “The Homosexual in America.” Dr. Weinberg used it for the first time in print in “Words for the New Culture,” an article in the newsweekly Gay in 1971, and discussed the phenomenon at length in his book “Society and the Healthy Homosexual,” published in 1972.

The invention of the term was “a milestone,” Dr. Herek wrote in the journal Sexuality Research & Social Policy in 2004. “It crystallized the experiences of rejection, hostility and invisibility that homosexual men and women in mid-20th-century North America had experienced throughout their lives.

“The term stood a central assumption of heterosexual society on its head,” he continued, “by locating the ‘problem’ of homosexuality not in homosexual people, but in heterosexuals who were intolerant of gay men and lesbians.”

George Henry Weinberg was born on May 17, 1929, in Manhattan, where he grew up in Washington Heights. His father, Frederick, was a lawyer who left the family when his son was just a few months old. George did not see him again until he was 18. His mother, the former Lillian Hyman, who had never advanced beyond the seventh grade, took a typing course and found work as a legal secretary.

He attended City College, where his skill at poker and billiards helped defray his living expenses, and earned a master’s degree in English from New York University in 1951, writing a thesis on Samuel Johnson. He remained a passionate Shakespearean, mining the plays for psychological insights that led to two books, “Shakespeare on Love” (1991) and “Will Power! Using Shakespeare’s Insights to Transform Your Life” (1996), written with Ms. Rowe, his sole survivor.

He studied mathematics and statistics at the Courant Institute, a part of New York University — he would later write a textbook, “Statistics: An Intuitive Approach” (1974), and a mathematical fable, “Numberland” (1987) — but found that he enjoyed talking to people about their problems and trying to solve them.

He left math behind and earned a doctorate in clinical psychology from Columbia, writing his dissertation on clinical versus statistical prediction in psychology.

Dr. Weinberg wrote several books aimed at the general reader. He dealt with personality formation in “The Action Approach: How Your Personality Developed and How You Can Change It” (1969) and “Self Creation” (1978); with obsessive behavior in “Invisible Masters: Compulsions and the Fear That Drives Them” (1993); and with relationship problems in “Why Men Won’t Commit: Getting What You Both Want Without Playing Games” (2003).

He was best known, however, for “Society and the Healthy Homosexual,” one of the first books to reject the idea, prevalent in the psychiatric profession, that homosexuality was a psychological disorder.

Dr. Weinberg, a staunch and very public advocate of gay rights, helped lead the campaign that led the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from the second edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, a handbook of psychological disorders.

“I felt like an apostle of the obvious, and people imagined I was doing something daring,” he told Gay Today in 2002.

Over time, “homophobia” evolved from a rallying cry to a contested term. Critics, both gay and heterosexual, argued that however useful the word might be as a political tool, or as a consciousness raiser, it did not withstand scrutiny. Homophobia, they pointed out, was not precisely equivalent to an irrational fear of snakes or heights, and the emotions associated with it were more likely to be anger or disgust than fear. Its meaning had become too diffuse, they argued, covering everything from physical assault to private thoughts to government policies.

In 1992, The Associated Press, in a revision of its stylebook, discouraged use of the word. “Phobia means irrational, uncontrollable fear, often a form of mental illness,” David Minthorn, The A.P.’s deputy standards editor, wrote in a column. “In terms like homophobia, it’s often speculation. The reasons for anti-gay feelings or actions may not be apparent. Specifics are better than vague characterizations of a person’s general feelings about something.”

Dr. Weinberg remained unconvinced. The phenomenon still existed, he asserted, and only one word did it justice.

“As long as homophobia exists, as long as gay people suffer from homophobic acts, the word will remain crucial to our humanity,” he wrote in The Huffington Post. “Indeed, the next big step should be to add ‘homophobia’ to the official list of mental disorders — not to cleanse the language of it.”

Republican aides responded with talking points that Judge Gorsuch was not on the panel in the case and did not invent the relevant legal test. He was merely following binding precedent, they said.

Judge Gorsuch’s opinion for a unanimous three-judge panel came in a ruling against an autistic student whose parents sought reimbursement for his education under a federal law, the Individuals with Disability Education Act.

On Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch said he had merely applied a standard set out in a Supreme Court decision as interpreted by an earlier decision of his court, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver.

At about the same time Judge Gorsuch was speaking, the Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision saying the 10th Circuit had been wrong. All that was required from public school systems, the 10th Circuit had said, was a “more than de minimis” benefit.

Writing for the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts. disagreed. “When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing ‘merely more than de minimis’ progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.”

Asked about the Supreme Court decision later on Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch said he had been bound by precedent in the opinion he had written.

Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he was sure the House would pass the repeal bill. “Slowly but surely we’re getting there,” he said. “There is no Plan B. There’s Plan A and Plan A. We’re going to get this done.”

Mary Maples Dunn, Advocate of Women’s Colleges, Dies at 85. Mary Maples Dunn, an educator who brought a scholar’s knowledge of the history of women to her long tenure as president of Smith College and who defended the role of women’s colleges in an increasingly diversifying society, died on Sunday in Winston-Salem, N.C. She was 85.

Her daughter Cecilia Dunn said the cause was heart failure caused by pulmonary hypertension. Ms. Dunn, who had homes in Cambridge, Mass., and Philadelphia, died while visiting family in Winston-Salem.

Ms. Dunn spent most of her career at women’s colleges, which had been established long before women were admitted to many colleges and universities throughout the United States.

When she became Smith’s eighth president in 1985, the need for women’s colleges was being widely debated; in the previous 15 years or so, many all-male universities had opened their doors to women. But she maintained that all-female colleges remained essential.

“In women’s institutions, women experience autonomy and power,” she said in her inaugural address. “There are no choices they cannot make freely and without those subtle social obstacles which still suggest to women that there are things we shouldn’t do.”

Still, she said, she foresaw a future in which segregation by gender would no longer make sense in higher education. Indeed, in 1999, she was interim dean at the all-female Radcliffe College in Cambridge when it merged with Harvard University, its brother school, which had begun admitting women in the 1970s.

At Smith, in Northampton, Mass. — one of the originally all-female Northeast colleges known as the Seven Sisters — Ms. Dunn made racial diversity a goal at what was long considered a conservative institution, founded in 1875, with a long list of notable alumnae, including Sylvia Plath, Julia Child, Barbara Bush, Nancy Reagan, Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem.

Her diversity project was prompted in part by a number of racist incidents on campus. In 1986, someone painted racial slurs on the steps of a minority cultural center. In later years, racist notes were sent to several minority students, prompting protests and a debate about racial attitudes on campus.

Ms. Dunn instituted a program to encourage inclusiveness and institutional diversity and increased the hiring and enrollment of minority students. By the time she stepped down in 1995, minority enrollment had risen to 571 from 342, out of a student body of about 2,800. And minority representation on the faculty had increased by about six teaching positions.

She also had a significant impact on Smith’s budget, which was burdened in part by a 1983 policy that accepted students regardless of their ability to pay and that made up the tuition difference with financial aid. Smith abandoned the policy in 1990, replacing it with one that distributed a limited amount of aid.

On another front, prompted in part by student protests, she persuaded Smith’s board of trustees to divest the college’s endowment of tens of millions of dollars invested in companies that did business with South Africa’s apartheid government.

When Ms. Dunn left Smith, its budget was balanced and its endowment had grown to $502.2 million from $216.9 million. Still, she told Smith Alumnae Quarterly, “I don’t want to be remembered as the grand accountant,” but rather as someone who fostered diversity.

“I would like to think that I had something to do with preparing the organization and the institution to live in a more diverse world than the one we used to inhabit,” she said. “This college will never go back to being a homogeneous, white, mainly Protestant, sometimes Jewish, enclave.”

Her successor was Ruth Simmons, who was the first black woman to lead Smith College and later the first African-American to lead an Ivy League university, Brown.

Mary Maples was born on April 6, 1931, in Sturgeon Bay, Wis. Her father, Frederic, owned a clothing store before joining the Army during World War II; he remained in the Army after the war and gave his family a peripatetic life as he was assigned from base to base. Her mother, Eva Moore Maples, was a homemaker.

Mary Maples received her bachelor’s degree from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., in 1954. She earned her master’s, in 1956, and her doctorate, in 1959 — both in colonial American history — from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, another of the Seven Sisters (the five others being Radcliffe, Barnard, Mount Holyoke, Vassar and Wellesley).

She began teaching at Bryn Mawr while working on her doctorate, then stayed on as a professor and historian who specialized in colonial America as well as the history of women. She became dean of the undergraduate college there in 1978 and academic deputy to the president in 1981.

In 1960 she married Richard S. Dunn, a scholar of American colonial history long associated with the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to him and her daughter Cecilia, she is survived by another daughter, Rebecca Dunn; a brother, Fred; and three grandchildren.

After leaving Smith, Ms. Dunn was for five years director of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at what was then Radcliffe College. She and her husband were co-executive officers of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia from 2002 until they retired in 2007.

Ms. Dunn’s belief in the value of women’s colleges remained firm, but she was also accepting of their evolution. After participating in the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe as Radcliffe’s interim dean in 1999, Ms. Dunn told The Boston Globe that the response from graduates was bittersweet.

“The most common message I’ve gotten,” she said, is, ‘I feel really sad, and I know it’s the right thing to do.’ ”Alexander Acosta, Labor Nominee, Dismisses Concerns Over Political Pressure. President Trump’s second pick to lead the Labor Department told senators on Wednesday that he would not allow partisan political considerations or conservative ideologues to shape his department, pushing back against accusations by Democrats that he had looked away as subordinates at the Justice Department stacked his office with ideological allies during the George W. Bush administration.

R. Alexander Acosta, the nominee for labor secretary, also defended his decision as the United States attorney in Southern Florida to offer a lenient plea deal to a wealthy New Yorker accused of paying underage girls for sexual acts.

For nearly three hours in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Mr. Acosta, 48, defended his record, explained how he might deal with budget cuts to the department and dismissed the concerns of several senators who asked how he would avoid any pressure from the president to pass policies based on politics and not on the best interest of workers. Mr. Acosta, who would be the only Hispanic in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, promised not to evaluate workers based on their political leanings.

“If confirmed, I will work to enforce the laws under the department’s jurisdiction fully and fairly,” Mr. Acosta said in his opening pitch to senators. “As a former prosecutor, I will always be on the side of the law and not any particular constituency.”

Mr. Acosta, the dean of Florida International University’s law school, was nominated after the president’s first choice for labor secretary, the fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder, withdrew from consideration after coming under fire for past labor practices and domestic abuse allegations. Mr. Acosta, a former prosecutor from Miami who headed the Justice Department’s civil rights division, appeared to be a far less contentious choice.

But Democratic senators did not go easy on him. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, wanted more details on his promise not to politicize the department.

“I expect our next secretary of labor to be someone who can withstand inappropriate political pressure, and prioritize workers and the mission of the Labor Department over, hypothetically speaking, President Trump’s business associates or Steve Bannon’s frightening ideology,” she said, referring to the senior White House adviser.

She and other Democrats pointed to a 2008 report by the Justice Department’s in-house investigator, which found that under Mr. Acosta his office had violated federal law and department policies by weighing political affiliations in hiring and assessing employees.

Mr. Acosta acknowledged that the violations had happened on his watch but said that the report laid most of the blame on a subordinate, Bradley Schlozman.

“Political views in the hiring of career attorneys and staff should not be used,” Mr. Acosta said. “If I am asked to do that, I will not allow it.”

Mr. Acosta had a lengthy discussion with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, on what critics said was the lenient plea deal given to Jeffrey E. Epstein, a wealthy financier accused of paying underage girls for sexual massages. Mr. Acosta defended the deal and said it was offered based on the evidence. Mr. Epstein, he noted, was required to register as a sex offender.

Mr. Acosta also seemed to question Mr. Trump’s proposal to cut the Labor Department’s budget by 21 percent, saying he opposed across-the-board cuts as well as targeting specific programs.

“The principle that needs to be used to guide the spending is, ‘How successful is the program?’” Mr. Acosta said.

He pledged to consult with local officials before making cuts to the department. He added that he hoped to help Americans “find good jobs, safe jobs.”

Most of the confirmation hearing was given to senators’ interrogating Mr. Acosta about how much of Mr. Trump’s agenda he would back and how he would help fulfill the president’s promises to create jobs and stop companies from moving jobs overseas.

Mr. Trump “ran for president saying he was going to make that huge difference — he was going to bring jobs back,” said Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado. “What’s the plan?”

Mr. Acosta answered that he would work with other agencies, like the Department of Education, in carrying out the president’s executive order directing department heads to review regulations.

Two Republican senators, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, both Cuban-Americans, like Mr. Acosta, introduced and praised him as an example of the American dream.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the committee, said Mr. Acosta would be a labor secretary who “understands how a good-paying job is critical to helping workers realize the American dream for themselves and for their families.”

The Senate labor committee is expected to vote next week on whether to advance Mr. Acosta’s nomination to the full Senate.

The Senate Agriculture Committee is scheduled to begin a confirmation hearing on Thursday for Sonny Perdue, the former governor of Georgia, to be Mr. Trump’s agriculture secretary. Hundreds of Syrian fighters and their American military advisers, backed by American artillery and attack helicopters, have begun a major operation to cut off the western approaches to Raqqa, the city the Islamic State has proclaimed as its capital, officials said Wednesday.

It was the first time that the United States had carried out an air assault with Syrian fighters in its campaign against the Islamic State, and the mission, which began Tuesday, reflected the leeway the Trump administration has given its commanders to carry out operations without prolonged review in Washington.

In a significant commitment of American forces, American helicopters ferried fighters across enemy lines while Marine Corps howitzers, Army Apache attack helicopters and American warplanes provided firepower for the operation. Army surface-to-surface Himars rockets, which are based in northern Syria, are also part of the mission. American Special Operations forces were advising the Syrian fighters on the ground, although a military spokesman said they were not involved in direct, front-line combat.

The mission represented a new stage in the broader offensive to cut off and seize Raqqa. Its objective was to take control of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River near Lake Assad, the nearby town of Tabqa and a local airfield. An immediate goal was to take the dam intact, but the structure was still under the control of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and officials said that the fighting was intense.

“The fighting is raging on as I speak and is expected to last several weeks until the dam, airfield and city are free from ISIS control,” said Col. Joseph E. Scrocca, a spokesman for the American-led command in Baghdad.

As the operation unfolded, Syrian state television and local residents asserted that at least 30 Syrian civilians were killed in an airstrike that hit a school where they had taken shelter in a rural area of Raqqa Province on Tuesday. American military officials acknowledged that the United States had been carrying out airstrikes in the area. These officials said they could not confirm the reports of civilian casualties, but would investigate.

As the battle for Raqqa has accelerated, the number of airstrikes has climbed. Colonel Scrocca said that over the past four months the American-led coalition had conducted more than 300 such strikes around Tabqa and west of Raqqa, and that enemy fighters, fortifications and vehicles had been targeted.

Describing the Tabqa operation, American officials said that a ground force of Syrian fighters was approaching the dam from the north. The airlift was carried out south of the dam, Colonel Scrocca said, and appeared to take the militants by surprise, Colonel Scrocca said.


Important details of the operation, including how many Syrian fighters and American advisers were involved, were not disclosed. News reports suggested 500 Syrian fighters had been deployed, but American officials hinted it could be much more.

“It could be 500; it could be a heck of a lot more,” Colonel Scrocca said in a briefing that was broadcast into the Pentagon.

American artillery and attack helicopters have not previously been employed in Syria. With this Tabqa operation, the American strategy in Syria has come to resemble the operation to retake Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, where conventional American military forces have been combined with the use of advisers to support local forces who are doing the main fighting on the ground.

One big difference, however, is the complexity of the local forces with which the United States is aligning itself.

In Iraq, the United States is supporting Iraqi government forces, namely Iraq’s Counterterrorism Service and its Army and Federal Police. In Syria, in contrast, the United States has been working with Arab fighters, the Kurdish Y.P.G. militia and local tribes.

Adding another layer of complexity, Turkey had objected vociferously to the role of the Kurdish Y.P.G. While American military commanders believe the Y.P.G. has some of the most experienced and proficient fighters, Turkey has denounced the organization as a terrorist group.

With Turkey’s concerns in mind, American military officials emphasized that Syrian Arabs made up 75 percent of the fighters in the Tabqa operation — while acknowledging that Syrian Kurds were also involved in the assault.

President Trump, who asserted during his campaign that he had a secret plan to defeat the Islamic State, has yet to outline a new strategy to “demolish and destroy” the militant group, as he told a joint session of Congress last month.

So far, the Trump administration has been operating within the broad contours of the approach by the Obama administration, which called for training and equipping local fighters, supporting them with American firepower and advisers — and, when deemed critically important, sending American commandos to hit high-value targets.

But the Trump White House has dispensed with the detailed and often prolonged review of operations and tactics that were conducted under the Obama administration. The change has allowed American commanders to step up the pace of their operations.

Pentagon officials said that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed of the Tabqa operation, as was the White House, but the assault was being carried out within the authority that has been delegated to American military commanders.

More flexibility for American commanders appears to be coming. Representative Mac Thornberry, Republican of Texas Republican and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters Wednesday that he expected the White House to remove “artificial troop caps” in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

The current “force manning level” for Syria sets a limit on the number of American military personnel in Syria at 503. But the limit does not count temporary reinforcements, like the roughly 400 personnel who were deployed in Syria when the Marine artillery battery and Army Rangers were sent to the country.

There was another telling indication on Wednesday that American Special Operations would continue to play an important role. Col. Jonathan P. Braga, the chief of staff of the Joint Special Operations Command and the former deputy commander of Delta Force, has been named as the next senior operations officer for the American-led command that is leading the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

With the stepped-up pace of military operations against the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, which is also operating in Syria, there has also been an increase in reports of civilian casualties. In the Tuesday episode, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that at least 33 civilians were killed when a school in Mansoura, a town 15 miles from Raqqa, was struck.

The United States Central Command is investigating an airstrike last week in Al Jinah, a village in western Aleppo Province.

American military officials said they had struck a gathering of Qaeda leaders and operatives and had killed dozens of militants. But residents said the airstrike had struck a mosque that was used by civilians for a weekly religious meIt has become something of an online custom in the social media age to react to tragic news stories — like Wednesday’s attack in London — with well-meaning if sometimes rote messages like “thoughts and prayers.” But that does not appear to be Donald Trump Jr.’s style.

“You have to be kidding me?!” Mr. Trump said Wednesday afternoon on Twitter, as details of the episode — which left at least five dead, including the assailant, and 40 injured — continued to unfold. The message continued, “Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan.”

Mr. Trump, the oldest son of President Trump, was calling attention to an article from September in The Independent, a British newspaper, that described Mr. Khan’s reaction to a bombing then in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City.
eting and that civilians had been killed and wounded. Donald Trump Jr. Criticizes London Mayor After Deadly Attack.  Mr. Trump mischaracterized the London mayor’s remarks. Mr. Khan did not describe terrorism as “part of living in a big city,” as if bombings and shootings were an inescapable fact of life. He said that terrorism preparedness, including providing sufficient support to the police, was “part and parcel of living in a great global city.”

“That means being vigilant, having a police force that is in touch with communities; it means the security services being ready, but it also means exchanging ideas and best practice,” Mr. Khan said in a video interview published by The Evening Standard, another British paper. (For the record, Mr. Khan did say the victims of the Chelsea bombing were in his “thoughts and prayers.”)

“Nothing is more important to me than keeping Londoners safe,” Mr. Khan added. “I want to be reassured that every single agency and individual involved in protecting our city has the resources and expertise they need to respond in the event that London is attacked.”

On Thursday morning, Mr. Khan said in an interview on CNN that he would not respond to Mr. Trump’s tweet because he had “been doing far more important things over the last 24 hours.”

“What I do know is that the threat level in London and across the country is severe,” he said. “That means an attack is highly likely. I was in New York last year when there was an attack in New York. And terrorists hate the fact that whether it’s New York, whether it’s London, whether it’s Paris, whether its Brussels, whether it’s Istanbul, whether it’s Madrid, we have diverse communities living together peacefully.”

Mr. Trump’s tweet was not well received by Britons, who were still learning details of the attack when he weighed in. On Twitter, Wes Streeting, a member of Parliament from the Labour Party, accused Mr. Trump of capitalizing on the attack in London and called him “a disgrace.”
Ciaran Jenkins, a correspondent for Britain’s Channel 4, asked the president’s son on Twitter if he thought his remarks were “helpful.”

“Did you even read the article before goading London’s Mayor during a live incident?” he wrote. He added, “Headline is based on very first sentence, which if you’d bothered to read it could apply to any major city in the world. Key word: ‘threat.’ ”

Mr. Trump declined to elaborate later on Wednesday. “I’m not going to comment on every tweet I send,” he said in an email.

Political violence in the United Kingdom is relatively rare. Decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland often spilled over, but there had not been a large-scale attack in Britain since 2005, when more than 50 people died in subway and bus attacks.
Supreme Court Rejects Education Minimum Applied by Gorsuch. Schools may not settle for minimal educational progress by disabled students, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday, rejecting a standard that some lower courts have applied, and that the nominee to join the high court, Neil M. Gorsuch, has been criticized for using.

The federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act requires “free appropriate public education” for all children. In multiple cases, the federal Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, has held that the law demands little “more than de minimis” — merely a program intended for a student to show some annual gains.

“It cannot be the case that the Act typically aims for grade-level advancement for children with disabilities who can be educated in the regular classroom, but is satisfied with barely more than de minimis progress for those who cannot,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for a unanimous court.

“When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing ‘merely more than de minimis’ progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all,” he wrote. “The IDEA demands more. It requires an educational program reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child’s circumstances.”

In a 2008 ruling, Judge Gorsuch, who sits on the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, applied the “de minimis” standard in rejecting a parents’ claim that a school’s provisions for their autistic child were inadequate.

Since Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court by President Trump, some Democrats have cited that and other opinions as evidence that the judge hews to an extreme conservative philosophy. At about the same time that Chief Justice Roberts was announcing the decision on Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch was questioned about the issue in a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

In the hearing, the judge noted, as he did in the 2008 ruling, that he had simply adhered to precedent, following a standard the appeals court had set in a 1996 ruling — which, in turn, cited rulings in other courts — and its understanding of a 1982 Supreme Court decision.

The Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday acknowledged that both the federal law, enacted in 1975 and amended a few times since then, and the 1982 ruling interpreting it, are vague about what schools must do. That is by design, the court said, because what is appropriate differs widely from one child to another.

“The de minimis standard was outrageous and really meant that schools could do nothing and get away with it, so of course we’re pleased that the court soundly rejected that,” said Curtis L. Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network. “But we would have preferred a clearer standard. The vagueness puts a burden on the family to try to show that their particular child needs a certain program to succeed.”

Nicole Jorwic, director of rights policy for the Arc, an advocacy organization for people with intellectual disabilities, said a review of Judge Gorsuch’s opinions related to people with disabilities “reveals an exceptionally narrow view of the protections offered by federal disability rights laws.” She said the Arc supported Wednesday’s Supreme Court ruling, but had not taken an official stance on whether Mr. Gorsuch should be confirmed.

“We would hope that in his future rulings, Judge Gorsuch would see that the purpose of IDEA is to help students with disabilities achieve more meaningful progress that can ultimately lead to their success and full life in their communities,” she said.

The case decided on Wednesday, Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District, concerns an autistic boy in Colorado, whose progress in school had stalled, in part because of his severe behavioral problems.

“Endrew would scream in class, climb over furniture and other students, and occasionally run away from school,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “He was afflicted by severe fears of commonplace things like flies, spills, and public restrooms.”

According to the parents, he needed a drastically different approach in school, but the district offered more of what was not working. So they put him in a private school specializing in educating autistic children, where his behavior and academic performance improved markedly.

The parents demanded reimbursement from the district for the cost of private school, arguing that the public schools had failed to meet the federal mandate. The Supreme Court did not directly address the question of reimbursement, but sent the case back to the lower courts for consideration. Arctic’s Winter Sea Ice Drops to Its Lowest Recorded Level. After a season that saw temperatures soar at the North Pole, the Arctic has less sea ice at winter’s end than ever before in nearly four decades of satellite measurements.

The extent of ice cover — a record low for the third straight year — is another indicator of the effects of global warming on the Arctic, a region that is among the hardest hit by climate change, scientists said.

“This is just another exclamation point on the overall loss of Arctic sea ice coverage that we’ve been seeing,” said Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-backed research agency in Boulder, Colo. “We’re heading for summers with no sea ice coverage at all.”

Dr. Serreze said that such a situation, which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall freeze-up begins, could occur by 2030, although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that.

The melting of sea ice does not raise sea levels, but loss of ice coverage can disrupt ecosystems. For example, it can affect the timing of blooms of phytoplankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain.

Less ice coverage also means that there is more dark ocean to absorb more of the sun’s energy, which leads to more warming and melting in a feedback loop called Arctic amplification.

The data center said on Wednesday that sea ice in the Arctic had reached maximum extent, of about 5.5 million square miles, on March 7. That is an area nearly twice the size of Australia, but about 470,000 square miles less than the average maximum from 1981 to 2010.

Much of the ice also appears to be thinner than normal, Dr. Serreze said, another result of the unusually warm temperatures in the Arctic this winter.

Late last fall, parts of the Arctic were more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than observed averages, and at the pole itself, mean temperatures for November were 23 degrees above normal. There were similar temperature spikes in December and this year.

“The Arctic Ocean was extremely warm over the winter, and there was a very impressive series of heat waves,” Dr. Serreze said. “I’ve never seen anything like this before.”

Less coverage and thinner ice mean that this summer’s minimum, which is expected to occur in September, is likely to be low. But there is no direct link between the maximum in March and the minimum after the melting season, said Walt Meier, a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory.

“Just because it’s a record low maximum, there’s no prediction it will be a record low minimum in September,” Dr. Meier said. “But while a lot can happen in the summer, when you start out at such a low level, you’re not going to get a very high minimum.”

Dr. Meier said that in addition to the low overall ice extent, some parts of the Arctic were almost completely devoid of ice this winter, including the Barents Sea off Norway and Russia.

“We haven’t seen much there at all,” he said, “and what there is will melt very quickly.” Large Sections of Australia’s Great Reef Are Now Dead, Scientists Find. SYDNEY, Australia — The Great Barrier Reef in Australia has long been one of the world’s most magnificent natural wonders, so enormous it can be seen from space, so beautiful it can move visitors to tears.

But the reef, and the profusion of sea creatures living near it, are in profound trouble.

Huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef, stretching across hundreds of miles of its most pristine northern sector, were recently found to be dead, killed last year by overheated seawater. More southerly sections around the middle of the reef that barely escaped then are bleaching now, a potential precursor to another die-off that could rob some of the reef’s most visited areas of color and life.

“We didn’t expect to see this level of destruction to the Great Barrier Reef for another 30 years,” said Terry P. Hughes, director of a government-funded center for coral reef studies at James Cook University in Australia and the lead author of a paper on the reef that is being published Thursday as the cover article of the journal Nature. “In the north, I saw hundreds of reefs — literally two-thirds of the reefs were dying and are now dead.”

The damage to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the world’s largest living structures, is part of a global calamity that has been unfolding intermittently for nearly two decades and seems to be intensifying. In the paper, dozens of scientists described the recent disaster as the third worldwide mass bleaching of coral reefs since 1998, but by far the most widespread and damaging.

The state of coral reefs is a telling sign of the health of the seas. Their distress and death are yet another marker of the ravages of global climate change.

If most of the world’s coral reefs die, as scientists fear is increasingly likely, some of the richest and most colorful life in the ocean could be lost, along with huge sums from reef tourism. In poorer countries, lives are at stake: Hundreds of millions of people get their protein primarily from reef fish, and the loss of that food supply could become a humanitarian crisis.

With this latest global bleaching in its third year, reef scientists say they have no doubt as to the responsible party.

They warned decades ago that the coral reefs would be at risk if human society kept burning fossil fuels at a runaway pace, releasing greenhouse gases that warm the ocean. Emissions continued to rise, and now the background ocean temperature is high enough that any temporary spike poses a critical risk to reefs.

“Climate change is not a future threat,” Professor Hughes said. “On the Great Barrier Reef, it’s been happening for 18 years.”

Corals require warm water to thrive, but they are exquisitely sensitive to extra heat. Just two or three degrees Fahrenheit of excess warming can sometimes kill the tiny creatures.

Globally, the ocean has warmed by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, by a conservative calculation, and a bit more in the tropics, home to many reefs. An additional kick was supplied by an El Niño weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet, causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880.

It was obvious last year that the corals on many reefs were likely to die, but now formal scientific assessments are coming in. The paper in Nature documents vast coral bleaching in 2016 along a 500-mile section of the reef north of Cairns, a city on Australia’s eastern coast.

Bleaching indicates that corals are under heat stress, but they do not always die and cooler water can help them recover. Subsequent surveys of the Great Barrier Reef, conducted late last year after the deadline for inclusion in the Nature paper, documented that extensive patches of reef had in fact died, and would not be likely to recover soon, if at all.

Professor Hughes led those surveys. He said that he and his students cried when he showed them maps of the damage, which he had calculated in part by flying low in small planes and helicopters.

His aerial surveys, combined with underwater measurements, found that 67 percent of the corals had died in a long stretch north of Port Douglas, and in patches, the mortality reached 83 percent.

By luck, a storm stirred the waters in the central and southern parts of the reef at a critical moment, cooling them, and mortality there was much lower — about 6 percent in a stretch off Townsville, and even lower in the southernmost part of the reef.

GREAT BARRIER REEF

But an Australian government study released last week found that over all, last year brought “the highest sea surface temperatures across the Great Barrier Reef on record.”

Only 9 percent of the reef has avoided bleaching since 1998, Professor Hughes said, and now, the less remote, more heavily visited stretch from Cairns south is in trouble again. Water temperatures there remain so high that another round of mass bleaching is underway, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority confirmed last week.

Professor Hughes said he hoped the die-off this time would not be as serious as last year’s, but “back-to-back bleaching is unheard-of in Australia.” The central and southern part of the reef had already been badly damaged by human activities like dredging and pollution.

The Australian government has tried to combat these local threats with its Reef 2050 plan, restricting port development, dredging and agricultural runoff, among other risks. But Professor Hughes’s research found that, given the high temperatures, these national efforts to improve water quality were not enough.

“The reefs in muddy water were just as fried as those in pristine water,” Professor Hughes said. “That’s not good news in terms of what you can do locally to prevent bleaching — the answer to that is not very much at all. You have to address climate change directly.”

With the election of Donald J. Trump as the American president, a recent global deal to tackle the problem, known as the Paris Agreement, seems to be in peril. Australia’s conservative government also continues to support fossil fuel development, including what many scientists and conservationists see as the reef’s most immediate threat — a proposed coal mine, expected to be among the world’s largest, to be built inland from the reef by the Adani Group, a conglomerate based in India.

“The fact is, Australia is the largest coal exporter in the world, and the last thing we should be doing to our greatest national asset is making the situation worse,” said Imogen Zethoven, campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society.

Australia relies on the Great Barrier Reef for about 70,000 jobs and billions of dollars annually in tourism revenue, and it is not yet clear how that economy will be affected by the reef’s deterioration. Even in hard-hit areas, large patches of the Great Barrier Reef survived, and guides will most likely take tourists there, avoiding the dead zones.

The global reef crisis does not necessarily mean extinction for coral species. The corals may save themselves, as many other creatures are attempting to do, by moving toward the poles as the Earth warms, establishing new reefs in cooler water.

But the changes humans are causing are so rapid, by geological standards, that it is not entirely clear that coral species will be able to keep up. And even if the corals do survive, that does not mean individual reefs will continue to thrive where they do now.

Coral reefs are sensitive systems, built by unusual animals. The corals themselves are tiny polyps that act like farmers, capturing colorful single-celled plants called algae that convert sunlight into food. The coral polyps form colonies and build a limestone scaffolding on which to live — a reef.

But when the water near a reef gets too hot, the algae begin producing toxins, and the corals expel them in self-defense, turning ghostly white. If water temperatures drop soon enough, the corals can grow new algae and survive, but if not, they may succumb to starvation or disease.

Even when the corals die, some reefs eventually recover. If water temperatures stay moderate, the damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years.

But the temperature of the ocean is now high enough that global mass bleaching events seem to be growing more frequent. If they become routine, many of the world’s hard-hit coral reefs may never be able to re-establish themselves.

Within a decade, certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct, reef scientists say, along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators.

“I don’t think the Great Barrier Reef will ever again be as great as it used to be — at least not in our lifetimes,” said C. Mark Eakin, a reef expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in Silver Spring, Md.

Dr. Eakin was an author of the new paper and heads a program called Coral Reef Watch, producing predictive maps to warn when coral bleaching is imminent. Even though last year’s El Niño has ended, water temperatures are high enough that his maps are showing continued hot water across millions of square miles of the ocean.

Kim M. Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the writing of the new paper, described it and the more recent findings as accurate, and depressing. She said she saw extensive coral devastation last year off Kiritimati Island, part of the Republic of Kiribati several thousand miles from Australia and a place she visits regularly in her research.

With the international effort to fight climate change at risk of losing momentum, “ocean temperatures continue to march upward,” Dr. Cobb said. “The idea that we’re going to have 20 or 30 years before we reach the next bleaching and mortality event for the corals is basically a fantasy.” The Pentagon is poised to significantly scale back a decade-long mission to capture or kill Joseph Kony, one of Africa’s most notorious warlords, in a sign that the United States and its African allies no longer see him as a regional threat.

Mr. Kony and his violent guerrilla group, the Lord’s Resistance Army, gained worldwide attention after the social media video “Kony 2012” was viewed more than 100 million times on YouTube. The L.R.A. is notorious for its use of child soldiers but has also carried out massacres, sexual violence, mutilations, pillage and abductions.

The Pentagon’s Africa Command now wants to shift from a counterinsurgency operation against the guerrilla group to building African defense institutions and a more narrow pursuit of Mr. Kony, whose fighting force has dwindled to about 100 soldiers from a peak of 3,000. That change could free up perhaps dozens of the approximately 150 United States troops now assigned to the effort, allowing them to undertake other Special Operations missions.

A decision on renewing the mission for six more months is scheduled for April, but the Trump administration, even before taking office, signaled its desire for change in a series of questions from its transition team to the State Department.

“The L.R.A. has never attacked U.S. interests, why do we care?” the Trump transition team asked. “I hear that even the Ugandans are looking to stop searching for him, since they no longer view him as a threat, so why do we?”

Mr. Kony and his militant force emerged in Uganda in 1987 to fight against President Yoweri Museveni. From 1987 to 2006, the armed group abducted more than 20,000 children to use as soldiers, servants or sex slaves, according to Unicef. The group’s violence has displaced more than 2.5 million people, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center reports.

In 2005, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Kony, a self-proclaimed prophet, for crimes against humanity and war crimes. In 2008, the United States government declared him a “specially designated global terrorist.”

Yet, Mr. Kony, who is believed to be in his 50s, has avoided capture for three decades. His troops operate in small groups spread throughout 115,000 square miles of lawless territory in the border region of Central African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. All of those, except Sudan, contribute forces to an African Union task force fighting against the L.R.A.

Mr. Kony is widely believed to be hiding in the disputed, mineral-rich area of Kafia Kingi in Sudan’s south Darfur state. Sudan’s military has not participated in combating the guerrilla group and, in 2013, nonprofit organizations reported that Sudan’s military had been harboring and supporting Mr. Kony and his forces.

Since 2008, the United States has provided support to military operations against Mr. Kony’s guerrillas. In 2011, the Obama administration went further, and deployed troops to the region to work with the African Union soldiers against the L.R.A., providing advisory support, intelligence and logistical assistance.

Since then, the Defense Department has spent more than $780 million on the mission, according to a Pentagon spokeswoman, Maj. Audricia Harris. About 150 service members, including three teams of Green Berets, are deployed to the effort.

The Africa Command is looking at “transitioning to the next phase” of the mission, according to Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, who oversees American Special Operations forces in Africa. He said it would probably be a phased decrease rather than a shutdown.

Others in the American Special Operations community argue that a long-term United States presence on the ground in these countries is in America’s national security interest, and warn against a precipitous withdrawal.

“Persistent presence is the best way to help locals serve as an antibody to extremism,” said retired Lt. Col. D. Scott Mann, a former member of the Green Berets who founded the nonprofit Stability Institute. “Without long-term measures like this campaign, the threats always come back. A small footprint of well-trained and resourced advisers can make a big impact.”

However, Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the head of the Africa Command, said in recent congressional testimony that the L.R.A. “does not currently threaten U.S. or western interests in the region.”

Senator Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who is the mission’s staunchest supporter in Congress, said that the hunt could continue effectively at smaller troop levels with an increased emphasis on intelligence.

“The military feels, and I can’t argue, that they can cut back on some of their resources and still handle the part that’s going to be necessary to ultimately bring him down,” Mr. Inhofe said in a telephone interview. “He is getting much older. He is not as energetic and frenetic as he had been. He’s reduced in his level of terror.”

Some policy analysts say the United States military should continue to focus on protecting local populations.

“The L.R.A. is a wounded tiger,” said Paul Ronan, the director of research and policy at Invisible Children, which was founded in 2004 to increase awareness of its activities. “But, even in a weakened state, it poses a severe threat.”

“A premature withdrawal of U.S. and Ugandan troops from eastern C.A.R. would create a security vacuum there that could enable a surge of violence against civilians, both by the L.R.A. and by other armed groups,” Mr. Ronan added, referring to Central African Republic.

Last June, the Uganda People’s Defense Force announced its troops would be withdrawn from the missions by the end of the year, but then reversed course. According to the African Union Commission, Uganda has provided the bulk of the African Union forces — about 2,000 of 3,085 — with most deployed in southeastern Central African Republic. A Ugandan military officer based in Obo, Central African Republic, said that Ugandan forces were likely to depart when the Americans did.

A withdrawal of Ugandan troops would make the hunt for Mr. Kony even tougher, requiring “much more direct cooperation with the Sudanese government,” Mr. Ronan said. However, he added that he did not have “any indication that the Sudanese are willing to cooperate at that level.”

On the campaign trail, Donald J. Trump falsely accused President Barack Obama of founding the Islamic State. He said Mr. Obama “did not get it,” in terms of fighting the extremist group that is based in Iraq and Syria, and vowed to obliterate them on the battlefield.

But in the Trump administration’s first major announcement of its still-nascent plans to defeat the militants, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Wednesday closely parroted Mr. Obama’s strategy. His comments came as talk of fighting the Islamic State was overshadowed by an attack in London that killed four and injured 40. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, or if the Islamic State was linked to it.

“The great commonality among we who have gathered today is a commitment to bringing down a global force of evil,” Mr. Tillerson said at the start of a conclave of the 68-nation coalition to defeat the Islamic State that was held at State Department headquarters.

In his 20-minute speech, Mr. Tillerson noted that over the past year, the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria had dropped more than 90 percent, and that 75 percent of the Islamic State’s online propaganda had been eliminated. Both gains occurred largely on Mr. Obama’s watch.

“Reflecting on the past year or so, we should be encouraged by the significant progress we as a coalition are making,” Mr. Tillerson said.

Mr. Trump has long insisted that citing “radical Islamic terrorism” is key to defeating the Islamic State. “You can’t solve a problem if you refuse to talk about what the problem is,” he said in November 2015. Yet Mr. Tillerson used those three words together only once — when he requested that Saudi Arabia and Egypt do more to combat extremism.

Instead, in front of a room full of diplomats, including many from Muslim countries where Mr. Trump’s favored phrase is viewed as offensive, Mr. Tillerson emphasized a sympathetic view of Islam. He rejected characterizations by Michael T. Flynn, the retired Army general and former national security adviser to Mr. Trump, that the religion is a “malignant cancer.”

“We also must look this enemy’s ideology in the eyes for what it is: a warped interpretation of Islam that threatens all of our people,” Mr. Tillerson said in yet another passage that could have come from the playbook. He cited King Abdullah II of Jordan, who recently said of the extremists, “Everything they are, everything they do, is a blatant violation of my faith.”

Jon Finer, chief of staff under former Secretary of State John Kerry, said Mr. Tillerson’s speech felt very familiar.

“It was good to hear both that progress continues to be made in this critical fight, and that, after months of baseless criticism, the new administration seems to have decided to stick with a strategy that is working,” Mr. Finer said.

Among those in attendance at the conclave were the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson; the Saudi foreign minister, Adel Ahmed Al Jubeir; and Qatar’s foreign minister, Mohammed Abdulrahman Al-Thani.

At the White House, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, said that the Trump administration “will use all of the tools of national power, in coordination with our international partners, to cut off ISIS’s funding, expand intelligence sharing and deny ISIS geographic and online safe havens,” succinctly summarizing the Obama administration’s strategy as well. ISIS is another name for the Islamic State.

If there were differences with the past administration, they were mostly in Mr. Tillerson’s emphasis on fighting the Islamic State’s online recruitment and propaganda, and in stabilizing Iraq and Syria once the militants are defeated. Over the last month, the Iraqi Army has pushed into western Mosul, the northern Iraqi city that has been a hard-fought battleground. And just this week, Syrian fighters aided by American military advisers have moved to isolate Raqqa, the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed capital in northern Syria.

“We will continue to facilitate the return of people to their homes and work with local political leadership,” Mr. Tillerson said, adding, “As a coalition, we are not in the business of nation-building or reconstruction.”

Mr. Tillerson urged the diplomats gathered at Foggy Bottom to do more. He said the United States had so far provided 75 percent of the military resources and 25 percent of the humanitarian support used against the Islamic State.

“The United States will do its part, but the circumstances on the ground require more from all of you,” he said.

The only clear difference between the Obama strategy and that of the Trump administration has been a loosening of restrictions on airstrikes. The potential downside of that change came the day before the conference opened, when at least 30 Syrian civilians were killed in an airstrike.

Richard Atwood, New York director of the International Crisis Group, said in an interview that he was worried that growing civilian casualties, as well as the Trump administration’s decision to become more bellicose with Iran, could backfire and weaken the fight against the Islamic State.

In his remarks, Mr. Tillerson was complimentary of the Iraqi government; Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq sat on stage while Mr. Tillerson spoke. It was a notable inclusion, given that Mr. Abadi was infuriated by Mr. Trump’s first executive order, which banned travel from Iraq and six other Muslim-dominated countries. In an amended order, Mr. Trump dropped the travel restrictions against Iraq. Both orders have been suspended in court proceedings.

Mr. Abadi, in his own speech, seemed to promise that money spent on reconstructing Iraq would not be wasted, since he was also fighting corruption.

“Corruption and terrorism are a common plague,” he said. Search for Secret Service Leader Intensifies as White House Security Is Tested. In the century or so since Congress first assigned the Secret Service the task of protecting the president of the United States, its top job has always gone to an agency veteran.

Like so many things in the Trump era, that may soon change.

Aides to President Trump are narrowing a list of candidates to lead the Secret Service, the beleaguered agency that protects the country’s top government officials and investigates certain crimes.

Unlike in transitions past, no clear front-runner has emerged. But top aides have been looking at candidates inside and outside the agency who can improve its morale and regain the credibility lost after a string of embarrassing lapses. They hope to name a new director in the coming weeks.

The search has taken on new urgency in recent days, as a series of attempted intrusions on the White House grounds — including a successful one in which a man was able to wander close enough to peer through the windows — have reignited concerns about management, training and security vulnerabilities thought to be on the mend.

Critics of the agency have seized on the most recent cases to amplify calls for the White House to recruit a leader from outside the Secret Service, which would be unprecedented in the famously hidebound agency’s modern history. They insisted that only someone untethered from the agency’s ways of thinking could institute the kind of reforms necessary to guide the organization.

“I still believe they have a deep-seated cultural problem,” Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, and the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said in an interview. “We need a transformative figure to truly change the culture at the Secret Service.”

The agency has been without a permanent leader since early this month, when its director, Joseph P. Clancy, stepped down to allow Mr. Trump to shape it as he saw fit.

Since Mr. Clancy’s departure, the agency has again been tested by a series of attempted intrusions at the White House. The most serious of them happened March 10, when a California man carrying pepper spray and a letter for Mr. Trump scaled fences and roamed the grounds for 17 minutes before being caught. It has prompted both the Secret Service and the House oversight committee to open investigations.

After receiving a closed-door briefing on the incident on Monday, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the oversight committee’s top Democrat, said it was clear that the agency needed to go back “under the microscope.” He told reporters that “a culture of complacency” was plaguing certain parts of the agency.

At the same time, the Secret Service has found itself grappling with unexpected costs and travel demands posed by protecting Mr. Trump and his large family. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the agency had requested an additional $60 million in funds for next year to help pay for the protection of Mr. Trump’s Manhattan residence and the family’s higher-than-expected travel costs.

Indeed, few jobs in government matter more to the fate of the president or the country than director of the Secret Service. Though the agency oversees a vast investigations arm targeting counterfeiting and other financial crimes, its reputation rests on its protection of the presidency and many of the country’s most important figures.

“Quite literally, at the end of the day, it is going to come down to the president’s comfort,” said W. Ralph Basham, who served as director of the agency from 2003 to 2006. “If you are going to turn the security and safety of your family over to someone, the president needs to weigh in.”

John F. Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, whose department includes the Secret Service, will also have a say in the decision. “The U.S. Secret Service is a vital federal law enforcement partner and the White House is working closely with Secretary Kelly on filling this important position,” Michael Short, a White House spokesman, said on Tuesday.

In the interview, Mr. Chaffetz said he had pressed Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, and Donald McGahn, the White House counsel, to choose an outsider, in part because he saw no “natural fit” for the top job within its ranks.

But others briefed on the search pointed to several potential candidates within the agency or its pool of former agents. They include George D. Mulligan, the agency’s chief operating officer and No. 2; Robert Buster, who was the top agent in charge of President Obama’s security detail; and Mickey Nelson, a former assistant director overseeing the agency’s protective assignments, and now a security consultant. Only Mr. Mulligan is not a career Secret Service officer; he spent most of his career in the military.

William J. Callahan, the agency’s acting director, was briefly under consideration before he bowed out early this month, according to an official at the Department of Homeland Security.

Mr. Basham said he expected that the White House would also consider current or former leaders from the military, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other law enforcement agencies.

Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump’s longtime private security director who followed him to the White House, has also been mentioned in connection to the job.

Whomever Mr. Trump chooses will inherit an agency still trying to recover from a series of flaps between 2011 and 2014 that badly hurt its credibility. Those incidents, from highly publicized cases of drunken misbehavior by agents and officers to the failure to prevent an armed private security guard from riding in an elevator with Mr. Obama, prompted an investigation by the House oversight committee and the creation of a four-person independent panel convened by the Department of Homeland Security. Both groups eventually made recommendations that the agency look outside its ranks to help clean up the mess.

The low point came in September 2014, when an intruder armed with a knife, Omar J. Gonzalez, made it all the way to the ceremonial East Room of the White House. The incident prompted the agency’s director, Julia Pierson, to resign.

“These things have really undermined the confidence of the American people, the confidence of the Hill and even to some extent of the White House,” Mr. Basham said. “And that is something the next director is going to have to deal with.”

The new director will also be expected to re-evaluate whether the agency should narrow its mission to pare down some aspects of its investigative work and increase resources for protection. The Secret Service, once a unit of the Treasury Department, investigates counterfeiting and financial crimes.

Mr. Clancy, who was brought out of retirement by Mr. Obama to help stabilize the agency, began instituting many of the reforms called for by investigators. During his two years in office, he hired several top deputies from the outside to professionalize its leadership, including Mr. Mulligan. He pushed to extend overtime payments, a popular move among rank-and-file personnel. He also hired more agents and successfully oversaw protection during a highly charged political campaign.

Patrick O’Carroll, a former Secret Service agent who is the executive director of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said Mr. Clancy’s successor would have a daunting task. Last year, in a survey of the best places to work within the federal government, the agency ranked 305th out of 305 agencies. Compounding Pharmacy Owner Not Guilty of Murder After 60 Meningitis Deaths. The frightening pattern of sick patients emerged in 2012. First, two people died. Then it was eight. Then more. It was an outbreak of fungal meningitis, a rare disease that investigators linked to injections from a compounding pharmacy outside Boston.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that some 13,000 people in multiple states could have been injected with the possibly tainted medicine, and recipients waited anxiously to see if they developed symptoms.

In all, 732 people were sickened by the meningitis and other infections. Sixty-four people died. Many survivors live with constant pain.

On Wednesday, the first trial related to the outbreak ended in a split verdict: A jury here convicted Barry J. Cadden, 50, the owner and head pharmacist at the New England Compounding Center, of more than 50 counts of mail fraud and racketeering, but acquitted him of 25 counts of second-degree murder.

The acquittal on the murder charges dismayed some survivors of the outbreak and probably spared Mr. Cadden from a sentence of life in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for June 21; Mr. Cadden will remain free until then.

The acting United States attorney for Massachusetts, William D. Weinreb, said Mr. Cadden was being held accountable for serious crimes, despite the acquittals.

Officials looking into the New England Compounding Center case said investigators had found dirty mats and hoods, a leaky boiler, dark debris floating in vials of medicine, and evidence that the laboratory was not leaving enough time to properly sterilize some products. They also said that a supposedly clean room was infested with insects and mice.

At the time of the outbreak, one of the worst public health crises in the nation’s history, concern was rising over the quality of compounded drugs. Prosecutors said that Mr. Cadden had been told the drugs could have been contaminated, but that he recklessly disregarded industry regulations in pursuit of higher profit.

“This trial revealed that, among other things, Mr. Cadden participated in a massive fraud in which N.E.C.C. masqueraded as a pharmacy when it was in fact manufacturing drugs,” Mr. Weinreb said. “As a result of that, he managed to escape F.D.A. oversight of his actions, and 65 people died. Hundreds of others were injured.”

The defense argued that prosecutors had failed to show how the drugs had been contaminated or to specify any role that Mr. Cadden might have played in the deaths. On Wednesday, Mr. Cadden’s lawyer, Bruce A. Singal, pushed back against Mr. Weinreb’s comments, saying his client had not been convicted of massive fraud.

“It was a terrible lapse of judgment for the U.S. Attorney’s Office to accuse Mr. Cadden of murder in the first instance,” Mr. Singal wrote in an email. “For the prosecution to persist in trying to blame him for the deaths in the wake of acquittals on all 25 murders is irresponsible and reprehensible.”

Legal specialists said the burden of proof for the murder charges was ultimately too high.

“They were going to have to show that the pharmacist knew, or recklessly disregarded, that the vials they were shipping were going to cause infection or kill people,” said Kevin Outterson, a law professor at Boston University.

“You can have a bad lab that is sloppy, and you might know that you’re cutting corners to save money,” Mr. Outterson said. “That is completely different from somebody knowing their vials were contaminated and still shipping them nonetheless.”

Family members of the victims and survivors of the infections said they were dismayed that Mr. Cadden had not been convicted of murder.

“He was leveraging profit by not maintaining a proper facility, a sanitary facility,” said Bob Bergeson, 59, whose sister, Diana Reed, died of fungal meningitis during the outbreak, leaving behind a husband with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who now lives by himself. “That’s murder in my mind.”

Angel Farthing, 46, who was sickened with meningitis and now has scar tissue on her spine, said other survivors had expressed their frustration over the verdict in a private Facebook group. She said she still hoped that Mr. Cadden would spend years in jail.

“I have a lifetime sentence of pain,” Ms. Farthing said. “Standing hurts, bending over hurts, putting my socks on hurts.”

Each of the 52 mail fraud counts of which Mr. Cadden was convicted carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, although Mr. Weinreb, the prosecutor, did not say how much time he would seek. “I think the judge will have room to impose whatever sentence that he deems appropriate,” he said. ov. Jerry Brown arrived in Washington for his first trip to the capital during the Trump administration with an agenda full to the point of groaning. But in addition to infrastructure, immigration, health care and myriad other issues important to the nation’s largest state, he had another topic on his mind.

“The end of the world,” said Mr. Brown.

In a visit to The New York Times Washington bureau Tuesday, the always-spirited governor was at his most animated when discussing his work on the board of the Nuclear Threat Initiative and a threat he said should be taken more seriously.

“One bomb of 15 kilotons dropped in Washington from a terrorist from some material they put together — unlikely but highly possible — could kill 80,000 people instantly, 100,000 serious casualties, wipe out the president, most of the Congress, whoever is at the meeting and change America forever,” said Mr. Brown, tapping a conference table for emphasis. “End America as we know it. That is not inconceivable.”

The governor put in a plug for legislation sponsored by Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts that would require the president to receive congressional approval to use nuclear weapons.

Mr. Brown, though, did not only speak with wonder about the prospect of cataclysmic terror. There was also the time he stepped onto Donald J. Trump’s plane and laid eyes on a Renoir.

“I was very impressed,” he said.

It was in the 1990s and Mr. Brown had revived his career by becoming mayor of Oakland. He caught a ride on Mr. Trump’s jet as part of an effort to convince the future leader of the free world to open a casino in Oakland (which never happened).

But, Mr. Brown admitted, he could not be sure the artwork was an original.

“I didn’t look that close,” he said. Trump warns G.O.P. holdouts on health plan.

Mr. Trump plans to dismantle the climate change policies of his predecessor, Barack Obama.

The administration is not expected to say explicitly that the U.S. is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. But the policy reversals, which could be announced as soon as Thursday, would make it virtually impossible to meet emissions reduction goals under the deal.

He also lamented attacks on federal judges as “disheartening and demoralizing.” Mr. Trump has repeatedly made such attacks against those who rule against his administration. (The president was undeterred, later saying, “I’ll criticize judges.”)

Back Story

William Shatner has a birthday today.

So does the world-famous character that made his fortune: Capt. James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise, who set out “to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations” in the U.S. television show “Star Trek.”

A Canadian, Mr. Shatner trained as a Shakespearean actor before moving into TV and film.

In the mid-’60s, television executives rejected the first pilot of the show, but the second, in which Mr. Shatner played Kirk for the first time, fared better.

“I never thought it’d become a big deal, just 13 episodes and out,” Mr. Shatner told The New York Times Magazine in 2010.

In fact, it lasted 79. The show gained a cult following in syndication and spawned a pop cultural phenomenon with multiple television series (a new one is planned) and 13 feature films (and counting).

Mr. Shatner turns 86 today, but James Tiberius Kirk won’t be born for another 216 years.

Kenneth R. Rosen contributed reporting. U.S. Military Investigating Reports of Civilian Deaths in Syria Airstrike.
The United States military has begun formally investigating an American airstrike in Syria that officials said targeted dozens of Qaeda operatives at a meeting place that activists and local residents maintain was part of a religious complex where 49 civilians were killed.

United States Central Command has begun two investigations: one to determine whether there is credible evidence that civilians were killed in the strike, and another, broader inquiry into the overall operation and whether the building hit was indeed part of a complex belonging to the Omar ibn al-Khatab mosque.

Defense officials had acknowledged that the building hit in the March 16 airstrike was near a mosque, but they called it an “Al Qaeda meeting site” in Al Jinah, in Aleppo Province. Military officials said intelligence had indicated that Al Qaeda used the partially constructed community meeting hall as a gathering site and as a place to educate and indoctrinate fighters.

But the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 49 people had been killed in what the monitoring group described as a “massacre” of civilians who were participating in religious instruction. Residents have described the building as an assembly hall and dining area for worshipers who gathered for religious lessons, and have produced photographs taken at the site after the strike that show a black sign outside a still-standing adjoining structure that identifies it as part of the Omar ibn al-Khatab mosque.

Last week, the Pentagon released its own photograph that showed a blackened crater where a building once stood in the village. An adjoining structure appears to be largely intact, as do about a dozen vehicles on the street. A small mosque across the street appears to be unscathed.

“We take extraordinary measures to mitigate the loss of civilian life in our operations,” Eric Pahon, a Defense Department spokesman, said on Tuesday. He added that “we are aware of claims of civilian casualties.”

Col. John J. Thomas, the spokesman for Central Command, said that the credibility assessment investigation would look into the question of civilian casualties. The broader investigation, he said — called a 15-6 in military parlance — will seek to clarify the purpose of the building that was bombed, as well as whether it was used by people other than members of Al Qaeda. “We’re investigating because we would like to look into it and find out if we can learn anything,” he said.

Investigators will review the intelligence that led to the airstrike, as well as videos, photographs and other documentation. American military investigators will also try to talk to witnesses, although it is unclear whether they will be able to visit the site given the limited number of American personnel in Syria.

Capt. Jeff Davis, another spokesman for the Defense Department, told reporters this week that the military does not strike mosques. Qaeda members and other militants are believed to have long understood that the United States’ rules of engagement discourage attacks on mosques, schools and hospitals without extensive scrutiny from top-level officials. As a result, militants have often operated in these places, in the assumption that doing so affords them some protection.

But large mosques can consist of multiple buildings, used by civilians for wedding parties and religious endeavors.

President Trump has indicated that unlike President Barack Obama, who had his White House scrutinize many military operations, he will leave more operational decision-making to the Pentagon and to American commanders in the field.

That streamlined decision-making has been welcomed by many in the military, who often expressed frustration at what they saw as a slow decision-making process in Mr. Obama’s White House. But it has raised questions about whether Mr. Trump is exercising sufficient oversight.  9 Deaths Are Linked to Rare Cancer From Breast Implants.
A rare cancer first linked to breast implants in 2011 has now been associated with nine deaths, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday.

As of Feb. 1, the agency had received a total of 359 reports of the cancer associated with the implants. The deaths were not caused by breast cancer, the agency said, but by a rare malignancy in the immune system, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. In cases linked to implants, this rare form of cancer grows in the breast, usually in the capsule of scar tissue that forms around an implant. It is usually treatable and not often fatal.

The problem is more likely to occur with textured implants, which have a pebbly surface, than with smooth implants, the agency said. Of the 359 reported cases, 231 included information about the implant surface: 203 were textured, and 28 smooth.

The contents of the implants appeared much less important: Of 312 cases where the contents were known, 186 were filled with silicone gel, and 126 with saline.

Cases generally come to light when symptoms develop, like lumps, pain, fluid buildup and swelling.

The agency said it was impossible to say how many cases exist, because of limited reporting of problems and a lack of worldwide sales data on implants.

About 290,000 women in the United States had implants for breast enlargement in 2016, and 109,000 received them for reconstruction after breast cancer, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

In many cases when the lymphoma occurs, just removing the implant and the tissue around it eliminates the disease. But some women may need chemotherapy and radiation.

Why there is a difference in risk related to the surfaces is not known, but the body’s reaction to textured implants is different from its reaction to smooth ones, according to Dr. Alex K. Wong, a plastic surgeon and researcher at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. Tissue grows into microscopic grooves in the textured implants.

“When we take these out, you can hear a peeling sound,” Dr. Wong said. “Whereas with a smooth implant, it’s like Jell-O. You can spin it around. It moves really easily.”

Studies in rats in his laboratory show different levels of genetic activity in the animals’ tissues in response to smooth versus textured implants.

“We’re still trying to find out why the surface matters,” he said, adding that in some cases the cancer seems also to be associated with a certain bacterial infection.

Surgeons use textured implants if they want the implant to stick in place and not move, which is important for newer, anatomically shaped implants that would look bad if they were to shift or turn upside down.

The F.D.A. says doctors should consider the possibility of lymphoma in women who start having breast problems a long time after implant surgery.

If a woman with implants has no problems, there is no reason to remove them, the F.D.A. says, emphasizing that the lymphoma seems to be very rare.

But women receiving implants should be aware of the potential problem and the increased risk with textured implants, the agency says.

A spokeswoman for the F.D.A., Stephanie Caccomo, said Tuesday’s announcement was made because “in 2016, there were several advances in the description of the disease and treatment recommendations, including recognition of the disease by the World Health Organization and publication of diagnosis and treatment guidelines by the Plastic Surgery Foundation and National Comprehensive Cancer Network.”
Philadelphia Prosecutor Indicted on Corruption Charges. R. Seth Williams, the embattled district attorney for Philadelphia, was indicted Tuesday on bribery and fraud charges, a remarkable turn for the city’s top prosecutor, who was considered a rising Democratic star before he became embroiled in scandal and ethics violations.

A 50-page, 23-count indictment accused Mr. Williams of accepting lavish gifts — including trips to a Dominican resort, Burberry accessories, checks for thousands of dollars and a custom sofa worth $3,212 — from businessmen for whom he was willing to do favors. The indictment also accused Mr. Williams of diverting money from a relative’s pension and Social Security for his personal use.

“Mr. Williams was willing to compromise his position of public trust in exchange for private financial gain,” said William E. Fitzpatrick, the acting United States attorney for New Jersey, who announced the charges.

A spokesman for Mr. Williams, Cameron Kline, declined to comment on the indictment. “The D.A. is not in the office today because he is spending time with his family,” Mr. Kline said.

Mayor Jim Kenney called on Mr. Williams to resign.

“It is disheartening to see yet another elected official give the public a reason not to trust us,” Mr. Kenney said.

Mr. Williams has already paid a $62,000 fine to the city’s Board of Ethics after failing to disclose more than $160,000 in gifts. Last month, he told reporters he had ended his run for a third term.

“My decision to accept gifts and fail to report them brought much embarrassment, shame and adverse publicity to me and, unfortunately, to the office for which I love,” Mr. Williams, 50, said last month. “For this, I will always hold deep regret in my heart.”

But according to federal prosecutors, Mr. Williams’s problems went beyond a failure to disclose.

The indictment said he had accepted gifts, including trips to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and items worth thousands of dollars, from a businessman who asked him for favors.

“I am merely a thankful beggar and don’t want to overstep my bounds in asking … but we will gladly go,” Mr. Williams wrote in a text message, which the indictment said referred to one of the trips.

Several months later, the businessman followed up with questions about a friend’s case. According to the indictment, Mr. Williams responded: “In the future always give me at least a week to help a friend ... I have no problem looking into anything … I can’t promise I will drastically change anything once it has gotten to the trial stage but I can always look into it.”

The indictment also claimed that Mr. Williams accepted numerous flights and even a 1997 Jaguar from a second businessman, whom he named a “special adviser.” He also wrote a letter to further his friend’s business interests, it said.

The indictment does not name the businessmen, but it notes that one of them gave Mr. Williams a gift of $7,000 in 2013. The settlement with the Ethics Board mentions a gift of $7,000 in the same year from Mohammad N. Ali.

Before he was elected district attorney in 2009, Mr. Williams was an assistant district attorney and the city’s inspector general — charged with rooting out corruption. He drew national attention early in his term by reducing penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana.

And he got caught in the drama surrounding Pennsylvania’s now-disgraced attorney general, Kathleen G. Kane, when some of his prosecutors were found to be involved in lewd email chains that Ms. Kane had uncovered when they worked for the attorney general’s office. He pursued charges that Ms. Kane had dropped against Democratic lawmakers because, she said, they were racially motivated.

“He came in with a lot of promise, and he, of his own mechanizations, messed it up,” said Linn Washington, a professor of journalism at Temple University who has covered criminal justice in Philadelphia for several decades.

Mr. Fitzpatrick, the acting United States attorney, said investigators had not uncovered information that cast doubt on the work of other prosecutors in Mr. Williams’s office.

But observers like Mr. Washington said the accusations could cascade through the city’s criminal justice system.

“It will cast doubt on the character of the prosecutions, because this is not just corruption where he’s putting money in his pocket — these are allegations that money was taken to change results in the justice system,” Mr. Washington said. “It’s going to raise a huge red flag over the office and what it operated under.”
Supreme Court Limits President’s Power to Fill Vacant Posts.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday restricted a president’s options in temporarily filling vacant government posts, a crucial matter when partisan tensions make it hard to win Senate confirmation for appointees.

For hundreds of jobs requiring Senate confirmation, federal law allows presidents to appoint officials on an acting basis without lawmakers’ approval, to keep agencies running. At times, a president has then nominated the acting official to take over the post long-term.

That practice violates the law, the Supreme Court ruled; a person who has been nominated for a position cannot hold the same job on an acting basis. That effectively makes it much harder for presidents to have their preferred people running federal agencies when — as was often the case during the Obama administration — the Senate delays voting on nominations, or does not act on them at all.

The 6-to-2 decision, written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., means that 112 federal officials — under three presidents and in myriad agencies — served through invalid appointments since the current version of the law was enacted in 1998. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.

In the majority opinion, the court did not address whether the ruling could also invalidate actions taken by those acting officials. But experts who have followed the case, National Labor Relations Board v. SW General, said such consequences should be limited.

Generally, the time frame for challenging those officials’ actions has expired, and in many cases, “all that has to happen is for another, properly seated holder of that post to ratify the actions” retroactively, said Steven M. Swirsky of Epstein Becker & Green in New York.

“The bigger deal is how it impacts the ability to make appointments going forward,” he said.

Usually, when a position becomes vacant, the first assistant to that post takes over on an acting basis, but the law allows the president to choose someone else, from a limited set of officials. For more than 15 years, the 1998 law was widely understood to bar the first assistant — but not any of the other qualified officials — from filling the higher role on an acting basis if that person was nominated for long-term appointment to that post.

That the law was generally misinterpreted, and that no one raised objections, does not change its meaning, Justice Roberts wrote.

In 2010, the general counsel of the labor board resigned, and President Barack Obama named Lafe Solomon, who was not the first assistant, as acting general counsel. A year later, the president nominated Mr. Solomon to be general counsel, and he continued to do the job on an acting basis as he awaited Senate confirmation. But for more than two years, the Senate did not act on the appointment, and it was withdrawn.

In 2013, while Mr. Solomon’s appointment was awaiting Senate action, the labor board took on a complaint against SW General, an ambulance company, ultimately finding against the company in a pay dispute. The company later sued, arguing that the board’s action was invalid because Mr. Solomon’s appointment was invalid.

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in SW General’s favor, a decision that quickly had consequences for Mr. Obama’s ability to fill positions.

In one prominent example, in January 2016, Eric K. Fanning stepped down as acting secretary of the Army so that the president could appoint him on a long-term basis. Mr. Fanning was not confirmed until that May.
If President Trump has a secret plan to defeat the Islamic State, as he promised during the presidential campaign, then his international allies in that fight are hoping to get a glimpse of it on Wednesday.

And if Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson hopes to reverse a growing impression of his own inefficacy in government, he will have no better opportunity than this week.

Diplomats from around the world are set to gather at the State Department on Wednesday for the Trump administration’s first meeting of the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State. Although such meetings have occurred regularly for years, this is the first since December 2014 in which representatives from all 68 countries of the coalition are expected to attend.

“Nobody wants to miss this meeting,” said Julianne Smith, a former Defense Department official and deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “They’re all thinking this would be the opportunity for the administration to let them in on any shift in U.S. policy or strategy.”

The conclave is the first major diplomatic event hosted by Mr. Tillerson. And like a debutante at a coming-out party, Mr. Tillerson will face intense scrutiny about his status from a crowd that is expert in gauging power.

At this point in his tenure at the State Department’s helm, Mr. Tillerson has yet to persuade anyone that he has much influence over Mr. Trump or the direction of American policy. His inability or unwillingness to choose his own deputy, protect his department from proposed deep budget cuts, attend meetings with foreign leaders at the White House or effectively manage the narrative of his foreign trips all suggest that he may be a marginal player in an administration dominated by the top White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Jared Kushner.

Wednesday will be Mr. Tillerson’s first good opportunity to change that impression, which is essential if he wants to be included in the world’s most exclusive councils of power.

But managing a meeting of 67 counterparts, many of whom he has yet to meet personally, would test even the most seasoned diplomat, and it involves the kind of complex multiparty haggling that few chief executives know how to handle. Mr. Tillerson was chief executive of Exxon Mobil, where quiet one-on-one deal making was the rule.

His only genuine multilateral meeting as secretary so far was a February gathering in Germany, attended by foreign ministers from countries in the Group of 20, but he largely kept his mouth shut. This time, he must give a welcoming speech, and there will be disappointment if he fails to make any substantive pronouncements.

The problem is, Mr. Tillerson may not have much to say. During the campaign, Mr. Trump’s chief foreign policy pledges were to be tougher on China and the Islamic State than President Barack Obama had been. But so far, there are few indications that Mr. Trump intends to do so as president.

Mr. Tillerson’s trip last week to China was surprisingly conciliatory, and the Trump administration’s effort against the Islamic State has so far been almost identical to Mr. Obama’s, with a heavy reliance on supporting indigenous armies to fight their own wars instead of deploying large numbers of American forces to far-flung hot spots.

Indeed, Mr. Tillerson has already explained that one reason his department should see its budget slashed is that he expects the United States to be engaged in fewer foreign conflicts, not more.

After an Oval Office meeting on Monday with Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq told an audience at the United States Institute of Peace that he had been “given assurances that the support will not only continue but will accelerate” in Baghdad’s battle against the Islamic State.

The word “accelerate” is likely to be bandied about quite a bit in the next few days at Foggy Bottom, and it is one that Mark Toner, the State Department’s veteran spokesman, used repeatedly on Monday to describe the Trump administration’s plans.

Promising that “there’s going to be some new ideas put on the table,” Mr. Toner said Wednesday’s meeting was intended “to accelerate and focus more on how we can accelerate our efforts.”

Some counterterrorism experts said they hoped that a promised acceleration was genuine.

“I was not a particular fan of what the last administration did, which I would describe as relying on passivity, proxies and special forces,” said Michael E. Leiter, who stepped down in 2011 as head of the National Counterterrorism Center. “What I hope we see in this administration is selective, deeper engagements that give greater confidence to our allies so our partnerships are more meaningful.”

The Trump administration faces some difficult decisions in the coming months. These include how to safeguard the civilian population in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, now under attack, from further devastation; whether to include Kurdish forces in Syria in the coming attack on Raqqa, despite bitter opposition from Turkey’s government; and how to bolster Libya’s fragile government to resist a growing threat from the Islamic State. Family of C.I.A. Consultant Sues Iran Over His Disappearance.
The family of a part-time consultant for the C.I.A. who vanished a decade ago in Iran filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against that country, claiming that it had used a campaign of deception and lies to conceal its role in his imprisonment.

The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Washington on behalf of the wife of the missing man, Robert A. Levinson, and their seven children. The action is seeking unspecified damages from Iran for its alleged role in, among other things, inflicting emotional distress on the family of Mr. Levinson, a private investigator who was a former F.B.I. agent.

Other Americans once held by Iran as prisoners have filed lawsuits against the Tehran government, accusing it of hostage-taking, terrorism and torture. But the new action, which was also brought on behalf of Mr. Levinson, is unusual because Iranian officials have insisted since he disappeared that they know nothing about his whereabouts or what happened to him.

A lawyer who represents Mr. Levinson’s family called such claims hollow, adding that Iran had long been engaged in a campaign of disinformation about the missing man.

“We want justice, and this case calls out for justice,” the lawyer, David L. McGee, said in an interview. “We also want the world to know about Iran’s cruel and cynical behavior.”

A spokesman for Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations did not respond to two emails seeking comment.

The lawsuit could lead to a confrontation between President Trump and Iran over Mr. Levinson’s fate. American law enforcement officials have long believed that elements of Iran’s political, religious or intelligence hierarchy were involved in his capture and detention. But President Barack Obama never challenged Iran with those findings while in office, and Mr. Trump, who vowed in 2015 to bring Mr. Levinson home, has yet to do so.

Mr. Levinson traveled in March 2007 to an Iranian island on a rogue mission to recruit an intelligence source for the C.I.A. He has been seen since then only in a hostage videotape made in 2010 and in a series of photographs. While some experts believe Mr. Levinson died in captivity, his family believes he is still alive. If so, he would now be 69.

The 14-page lawsuit filing does not contain any new disclosures about Mr. Levinson. But the lawsuit asserts that the F.B.I. has “concluded” that the hostage videotape and photographs — neither of which provided clues about his captors’ identity — were part of an “Iranian attempt to create a false scenario that Robert Levinson was being held by some other country.”

Lindsay Ram, an F.B.I. spokeswoman, did not respond directly when asked if the bureau had concluded that individuals or entities in Iran were responsible for Mr. Levinson’s detention.

Last year, Mr. Levinson’s wife, Christine, filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeking numerous F.B.I. documents related to the bureau’s long-running investigation into her husband’s disappearance. But the F.B.I. denied her request, stating that since the inquiry personally involved Mr. Levinson, she would have to take steps like getting his approval or providing evidence that he is dead, a copy of that F.B.I. letter shows.

This month, a Florida state judge appointed Mrs. Levinson as her husband’s legal conservator, a posture that could overcome some of the F.B.I.’s objections. But Ms. Ram, the spokeswoman, said that as a matter of policy the bureau does not release documents about cases that are “ongoing.”

Mr. McGee said he was disappointed by the F.B.I.’s position, particularly given the missing investigator’s two decades of service as an agent.

“As long as they keep this investigation open, the F.B.I. is not obliged to tell the family what it has done on Bob’s behalf,” he said. Jerry Krause, Who Gave Michael Jordan His Supporting Cast, Dies at 77. Jerry Krause, the general manager who orchestrated the Chicago Bulls’ dynasty of the 1990s, assembling the teams that Michael Jordan led to six N.B.A. championships, has died. He was 77.

The Bulls announced his death on Tuesday, giving no other details. The Chicago Tribune reported that he had been treated for osteomyelitis, a bone infection, among other health problems.

Krause never played or coached basketball, but he was an astute judge of talent as a scout for major league baseball teams and for N.B.A. organizations. He was hired to run the Bulls’ front office in March 1985 by Jerry Reinsdorf, their new owner, who had been an owner of the Chicago White Sox when Krause scouted for them a few years before.

Jordan was flashing the brilliance that would bring him acclaim as one of the greatest players in basketball history, but the Bulls lacked a strong lineup to complement him.

Krause went on to obtain talented players like Scottie Pippen, Charles Oakley, Bill Cartwright, Steve Kerr, Dennis Rodman, Horace Grant, Toni Kukoc and Ron Harper.

“One guy can’t win a championship — never been done,” Krause said after the Bulls won their first league title in 1991. “We needed guys who could help take the pressure off Michael and hit their shots and get the rebounds and hound on defense.”

Having scouted Phil Jackson for the Baltimore Bullets when Jackson played for North Dakota, then having lost out on him to the Knicks in the 1967 draft, Krause hired Jackson as an assistant coach in 1987, when he was languishing as a head coach in a minor pro circuit. Krause named Jackson head coach in 1989.

The Bulls won N.B.A. championships from 1991 to 1993 and — after Jordan left to play minor league baseball and then returned — from 1996 to 1998, all under Jackson and the free-flowing triangle offense he learned from the assistant coach Tex Winter.

After the 1997-98 season, Jordan retired for the second time (he later returned to the N.B.A. with the Washington Wizards), Pippen joined the Houston Rockets and Jackson left for Los Angeles to be the Lakers’ head coach, going on to win five championships with them.

Reinsdorf and Krause tried to rebuild with young players after those departures, but the Bulls had five losing seasons, and Krause resigned near the end of the 2002-3 season.

Krause, a two-time N.B.A. executive of the year, had a tense relationship with both Jordan and Jackson.

Jordan was especially annoyed when Krause traded Oakley, a rugged forward and his protector on the court, to the Knicks in a 1988 deal that brought center Bill Cartwright to the Bulls.

“You can never sell your soul to a player,” Krause told The New York Times in 2014. “Michael barked a lot to the press about the Oakley deal and later on about bringing over Toni Kukoc. To be honest, we never really talked about personnel, except when we brought in Dennis Rodman. But I always had Jerry Reinsdorf’s support to do what he hired me to do.”

Before the Bulls opened their 1997-98 season, in search of a sixth championship, Krause was quoted as saying that players and coaches do not win championships; organizations do. Krause said later that he had been misquoted when one word — “alone,” after “championships” — was dropped, but it seemed that he was promoting himself at the expense of Jordan and Jackson.

Krause seemed decidedly out of place in the company of tall and trim athletes. He was 5 feet 6 inches or so, jowly and rumpled, and he weighed upward of 230 pounds. Jordan needled him by calling him “crumbs,” for doughnut flakes that he claimed to have spotted on Krause’s jacket lapels.

Krause had a cool relationship with Chicago sportswriters, confiding little about his thinking. And he was not widely appreciated by Bulls fans, who were enthralled with Jordan’s heroics, not the front-office figures who dealt with his contract demands.

“Jerry always took that knock: ‘Anybody could have built a team around Michael,’” John Paxson, who had played for Krause, said when he succeeded him as general manager. “It was always unfair. Jerry, for some reason, never got the respect he deserved.”

Jerome Krause was born in 1939 in Chicago, where his parents, Paul and Gertrude, owned a deli and later a shoe store. He was a second-string catcher at Taft High School, then attended Bradley University hoping to become a journalist. He was a student assistant to the basketball coach, charting plays, then quit school to pursue a career in sports and was hired as a “flunky,” as he told it, with the Chicago Cubs.

He began to scout for baseball and basketball teams, and while working for the Bullets, he drafted Earl Monroe out of little-known Winston-Salem State in 1967. He became a Bulls scout late in the 1960s and had a brief stint as their director of player personnel in 1976.

Krause was hired as a scout in 1978 by Bill Veeck, the White Sox owner, and three years later began working for Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn when they took over the team. He persuaded management to obtain Ozzie Guillen, their future All-Star shortstop and manager, from the San Diego Padres’ organization.

After leaving pro basketball, he returned to baseball, scouting for the Yankees, the Mets and the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Krause is survived by his wife, Thelma; his two children, Stacy and David; and four grandchildren, the Bulls said.

For all the championships he helped bring to the Bulls as an executive, Krause never forgot his first love in the sports world.

“My father is buried three gravestones from a stone: ‘Here lies the heart and soul of a newsreel cameraman,’” Krause told The Chicago Sun-Times in 2003. “When I die and they put up my stone, I want it to say, ‘Here lies the heart and soul of a scout.’”
For Bronx Man Facing Deportation, a Grace Period Nears Its End.
An undocumented immigrant from the Bronx who was featured in a recent New York Times article about people with old deportation orders was detained Tuesday after meeting with immigration agents in downtown Manhattan, his lawyer said.

It was the latest of several cases in which the government detained an undocumented immigrant who had been ordered deported but, under the Obama administration, allowed to stay in the United States.

The Times article on the subject this month featured Juan Vivares, 29, a Colombian electrician who was caught crossing the southern border into the United States illegally in 2011 and was ordered deported after losing his bid for asylum. He said he had come to the United States to escape paramilitary forces in Medellín who had tried to kill him over his political work for a mayoral candidate.

Mr. Vivares’s lawyer, Rebecca Press, has asked immigration agents to delay his deportation for family reasons, explaining that he is needed to care for the baby he has with his wife, Yahaira Burgos, an American citizen who works overnight shifts as a doorwoman at an apartment building on the Upper East Side. But his previous appeals for leniency have failed.

Members of Ms. Burgos’s union rallied Tuesday afternoon outside the offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, joining her in asking for Mr. Vivares’s release. Ms. Burgos said the immigration agent who detained Mr. Vivares on Tuesday “didn’t allow for us to explain our case — she didn’t allow us to talk and inform her how we pay taxes, what kind of person Juan is.”

Mr. Vivares is one of nearly a million people living in the United States illegally whom immigration judges have ordered deported, but who have been able to remain in the country for various reasons.

Some have been ordered deported without their knowledge after they missed hearings, in many cases because the notice of the hearing was sent to an outdated address. Some have deliberately evaded immigration officials, or agents simply lost track of them while their cases wound through the courts. Some come from countries that do not accept deportees from the United States, and so they cannot be sent back.

And in many cases, Immigration and Customs Enforcement delayed their deportations for humanitarian reasons or because they were not considered priorities under a set of guidelines released by the Obama administration in 2014. Under those guidelines, immigration agents were to prioritize deporting immigrants with serious criminal records, those who posed a threat to national security and those who had entered the country recently.

President Trump has criticized his predecessor for lax enforcement of immigration laws, and since Mr. Trump took office, ICE has begun targeting people it might have granted deportation delays in the past.

Rachael Yong Yow, a spokeswoman for the agency’s New York office, said Mr. Vivares had “exhausted all administrative options and has received a final order of removal from an immigration judge.”

“He is currently in ICE custody pending removal from the United States,” she said.

Mr. Vivares was first ordered deported in 2013 and lost the final appeal of his case in November. He was ordered to report for deportation on Tuesday, and though he considered defying the order, which would have made him a fugitive, he decided to show up.

“I would feel like an animal if I stay here and hide,” he said several weeks ago. “I want to prove that I can follow the laws. I want to make my case at this meeting, but I know that if I go, they’re going to deport me.”

Morton Deutsch, Expert on Conflict Resolution, Dies at 97.
After Morton Deutsch learned that Lydia Shapiro was sunbathing along the Charles River in Boston when she was supposed to be interviewing subjects for his sociological experiment, he resorted to a conventional means of resolving a workplace dispute: He abruptly fired her.

A little more than a year later, though, he took a more creative and constructive approach to repairing their frayed relationship: They became fully cooperative partners, husband and wife.

“I have accused Lydia of marrying me to get even, but she asserts it was pure masochism,” Professor Deutsch wryly recalled.

After completing his experiment in graduate school, Professor Deutsch, who died on March 13 in Manhattan at 97, perfected his formula for reconciliation to become a leading expert on conflict resolution and mediation.

He not only remained married for nearly seven decades, he also co-wrote a prescriptive book titled “Preventing World War III” (1962).

Whatever credit he might have deserved for thwarting another global military conflict, Professor Deutsch’s principles provided a theoretical framework for various Cold War negotiations, for court decisions that voided legally sanctioned racial segregation in the United States, and for Poland’s peaceful transition from Communist rule in 1989.

He served on the faculty at Teachers College of Columbia University from 1963 until he became professor emeritus in 1990. There he founded the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution (since renamed for him), which he ran until 1997.

“The Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice,” which he edited in 2006 with Peter T. Coleman and Eric C. Marcus, became a standard manual for dealing with labor, commercial, international and marital disputes.

John T. Jost, a social psychologist at New York University, wrote in 2006 in the journal Social Justice Research that “in what is probably Deutsch’s most influential book, ‘The Resolution of Conflict’ (1973), he summarized the lessons of his first 25 years of research on, among other things, cooperation and conflict.”

“The point,” Professor Jost wrote, “is that social forms are self-fulfilling, so that coercion, intimidation, deception, distrust and hostility are both causes and effects of competition, whereas assistance, openness, information sharing, perceived similarity, and friendliness are both causes and effects of cooperation.”

Morton Deutsch was born on Feb. 4, 1920, in the Bronx to Charles and Ida Deutsch, Jewish immigrants from what is now Poland. His father was a butter and egg wholesaler.



Morton Deutsch Teachers College Archives
Raised in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, he read Freud and Marx when he was 10, graduated from Townsend Harris Hall and entered City College when he was 15 planning to become a psychiatrist.

“I became disenchanted with the idea of being a pre-med student after dissecting a pig in a biology lab,” he recalled. “I was happy to switch to a psychology major.”

He received a bachelor of science degree from City College in 1939 and a master’s from the University of Pennsylvania.

“I grew up in a time when, as a Jew, I experienced many instances of prejudice, blatant as well as subtle, and could observe the gross acts of injustice being suffered by blacks,” he recalled in 1999 in an essay in “Reflections on 100 Years of Experimental Social Psychology.”

He did not merely observe. He contributed lunch money to the Spanish Loyalists in the 1930s; organized a protest against the quality of high school cafeteria food and a strike by fellow waiters at a summer resort during college; challenged what he considered racist statements by a professor; and, after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, enlisted in the Army Air Forces and flew 30 missions as a navigator over Nazi-occupied Europe.

“Being in World War II and experiencing the devastation and horror of war, even though I felt the war against the Nazis was justified, I became interested in prevention of war,” Professor Deutsch told Teachers College Today magazine in 2009.

It was at M.I.T., where he earned his doctorate on the G.I. Bill, where he also met his wife, Ms. Shapiro, who survives him and confirmed his death. He is also survived by their sons, Nick and Tony; four grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.

It was also at M.I.T. where he became a disciple of Kurt Lewin, the German-American psychologist whose favorite dictum was “There’s nothing so practical as a good theory.”

Professor Deutsch’s postgraduate studies in the late 1940s were heavily influenced by the atomic bombings of Japan, followed by the formation of the United Nations. His doctoral dissertation was the basis for his theory of cooperation and competition, which postulated that a group’s success depends on the extent to which its members believe their goals are shared and see a potential to make common cause.

He had in mind the United Nation’s Security Council, he said, when “I had an image of them either cooperating or competing and had different senses of what the consequences would be for the world.”

But the same rules applied for confrontations big and small, and, since he fired Ms. Shapiro, his researcher at M.I.T., Professor Deutsch said there were plenty of occasions to practice what he preached.

“In our 60 years of marriage,” he said, “I have had splendid opportunities to study conflict as a participant observer.”
Wyclef Jean Is Briefly Detained and Handcuffed in Los Angeles.
Wyclef Jean, the hip-hop artist, said he was handcuffed and briefly detained by deputies in Los Angeles on Tuesday after they mistook him for a suspect in a robbery near the studio where he had been working.

In a short video message on Twitter early in the morning, the musician was shown standing in the dark next to a patrol car with his hands behind his back. It was unclear who was shooting video.

“L.A., right now, coming from the studio,” Mr. Jean said. “Y’all see the police have handcuffs on me. They just took off my Haitian bandanna. That’s what’s going on right now with Wyclef in L.A. right now. The L.A.P.D. have me in cuffs for absolutely nothing.”

Sgt. C. Duncan, an officer with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department in West Hollywood, confirmed that Mr. Jean had been briefly detained. The episode started just after 1 a.m. Pacific time, when deputies were investigating a report that a man and a woman had been robbed at gunpoint and beaten at a Sunset Boulevard intersection.

Sgt. Duncan said in a telephone interview that the suspect was described as a black man with a dark hoodie who fled in a gold or tan Toyota. At about 1:25 a.m., deputies pulled over a vehicle matching that description driven by a woman with a male passenger. When the man, who later turned out to be Mr. Jean, was seen wearing a red bandana, the victims, contacted by radio, said that the suspect had also been wearing one, Sgt. Duncan said.

Mr. Jean and the woman were told to get out of the car, and Mr. Jean was handcuffed and detained, Sgt. Duncan said. They were released when the victims said there was no female in the getaway car, and the three deputies and the sergeant at the location with Mr. Jean were also informed that the real suspect had been arrested elsewhere.

Sgt. Duncan said the entire episode — from when Mr. Jean was pulled over until he was allowed to leave — lasted six minutes. Mr. Jean was given a business card and told that he could go to the sheriff’s station and speak to officials there about what had happened.

Mr. Jean’s first tweet was posted at 4 a.m. Eastern, and was followed by a series of them describing what happened.

Around 9 a.m., he summed up, “I was asked by the police to put my hands up. Then I was told do not move. I was instantly hand cuffed before being asked to identify myself.”

Later on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Jean released a statement in which the performer called for an investigation into racial profiling in the wake of the episode.

Nor was I told why I was being cuffed. In the process I said my name and told them they have wrong person.

— Wyclef Jean (@wyclef) March 21, 2017
Asked to respond to Mr. Jean’s remarks that he had identified himself, Sgt. Duncan said: “Just because someone tells me their name I have to verify it through legal means.”

The woman in the vehicle with Mr. Jean identified herself as Mr. Jean’s manager, he said.

Mr. Jean’s descriptions about what happened to him were circulated on Twitter, with some remarking that it was an example of how quickly black men are treated as suspects in their encounters with law enforcement officers.

A native of Haiti who grew up in New Jersey, Mr. Jean sold millions of albums in the 1990s as a member of the Fugees, the Grammy-winning hip-hop and R&B group that included Lauryn Hill and Mr. Jean’s cousin, Prakazrel Michel, known as Pras. As the Fugees dissolved, Mr. Jean began a prolific solo career, and he has also worked as a producer. Mr. Jean, 47, has also had a high profile outside of the music industry. He made an aborted bid for the presidency of Haiti after the earthquake there in 2010.
Devices Banned on Flights From 10 Countries Over ISIS Fears.
Intelligence showing that the Islamic State is developing a bomb hidden in portable electronics spurred the United States and Britain on Tuesday to bar passengers from airports in a total of 10 Muslim-majority countries from carrying laptop computers, iPads and other devices larger than a cellphone aboard direct inbound flights, two senior American counterterrorism officials said.

Two additional American officials said the explosives were designed to be hidden in laptop batteries. All four spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to publicly discuss the sensitive information.

The Trump administration maintained that the new restrictions did not signal a credible, specific threat of an imminent attack. Officials said the alert reflects concerns that the Islamic State is ready — or soon will be — to launch new capabilities against the West. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, declined to address the intelligence during a news media briefing on Tuesday.

Officials said passengers still could carry cellphones and other small devices into the airplane’s cabin, while larger items like laptops would have to be stowed with checked luggage.

In all, airports in 10 countries, stretching from North Africa to the Mideast and into Turkey, are affected by the new restrictions. Both the United States and Britain have imposed the ban on flights from some airports in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

Washington also has restricted some flights from Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. London, meanwhile, has additionally restricted flights from some airports in Lebanon and Tunisia.

The targeting of a jetliner using explosives shows how the Islamic State, which has long worked to inspire terrorist attacks, is trying to compete with groups like Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen. The Qaeda affiliate has spent years inventing explosives that are difficult to detect, including trying to disguise bombs in devices like cellphones. Now, American intelligence officials believe the Islamic State has also developed explosives that can be hidden in electronic devices, one of the senior counterterror officials said.

Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, who sits on the House Intelligence and Homeland Security Committees, said that government officials had called him on Saturday to alert him to the impending ban.

“It was based on intelligence reports that are fairly recent,” Mr. King said in a telephone interview. “Intelligence of something possibly planned.”

The Department of Homeland Security said the restricted items on flights to the United States included laptop computers, tablets, cameras, travel printers and games bigger than a phone. The restrictions would not apply to aircraft crews, officials said in a briefing to reporters to outline the terms of the ban.

The American ban on electronics applies only to flights on foreign carriers. It does not affect American-operated airlines, since they do not fly directly to the United States from 10 designated airports in eight countries — Amman, Jordan; Cairo; Istanbul; Jidda and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia; Kuwait City; Casablanca, Morocco; Doha, Qatar; and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Officials did not say how long the ban would remain in place or if other airports would be added.

In all, an estimated 50 flights each day into the United States would be affected. One of the world’s busiest airports, in Abu Dhabi, already requires American-bound passengers to undergo strict screening by United States customs officials before boarding flights. Abu Dhabi is one of 15 airports in the world to employ the Homeland Security preclearance techniques.

Several hours after the American action, the British government announced its own ban on electronic devices on flights.

The British ban affects domestic and foreign airlines, including British Airways, the country’s largest. Foreign airlines affected by the order include Turkish Airlines, EgyptAir and Royal Jordanian, among others, and it affects direct flights to the United Kingdom from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.

A British official said the U.K. ban resulted from the combination of an evolving threat picture and a proliferation of electronic devices that airline passengers carry on board.

Examples of attacks by extremist groups against transportation hubs over the past two years include the October 2015 bombing of an airliner in Egypt, the attempted airliner downing in Somalia last year and armed attacks against airports in Brussels and Istanbul in 2016.

The new bans on electronic devices have prompted a round of protests from passengers who now face the prospect of flying long hours without the use of laptops or tablets.

Banu Akdenizli, an associate professor of communication at Northwestern University’s campus in Doha, complained that the ban would affect her ability to work during a long flight to Greensboro, N.C., for a conference in April.

“This is a 20-hour flight,” she said. “I think as an academic or any business traveler, the function of a work flight is to be able to work on it, especially if you’re going to a conference.”

Osama Sharshar, a prominent Egyptian lawmaker and journalist who frequently travels to the United States, was critical of the changes and suggested President Trump issued the order simply to “please the right-wing extremists in America.”

“It will terribly affect me as a journalist, a lawmaker and a regular Egyptian,” he said. “I work on planes all the time. And the flight to the States is very long.”

The Homeland Security Department’s new ban appeared to take officials from some of the affected countries by surprise.

Ahmet Arslan, Turkey’s transport, maritime and communication minister, said the ban would be harmful to the United States’ airline industry — and to Turkey’s.

“Our problem is not how the practice would take place,” Mr. Arslan said. “The issue is, it can decrease the comfort of the passengers and reduce the numbers of passengers. We are emphasizing that this is not in the benefit of passengers, and we think that they should step back from this or ease it.”

Counterterrorism experts seemed equally divided over the need for the device ban.

Michael Chertoff, the former Homeland Security secretary, said the new policy made sense given the threats to aircraft from explosive devices and concerns about screening at the targeted airports.

“The challenge is to balance security without making it impossible to fly,” Mr. Chertoff said.

But Erroll Southers, director of the Homegrown Violent Extremism Studies Program at the University of Southern California, said the new guidance would do little to enhance security.

“This does little to minimize the threat of a remote-controlled I.E.D.,” he said, referring to improvised explosive devices hidden in checked baggage.

American intelligence officials did not cite threats against domestic airports, but one said the Transportation Security Administration has been on heightened alert at several airports. It was not clear if that alert was related to the new restrictions on electronic devices.

The restrictions follow other recent changes the T.S.A. has made in aviation security. Two weeks ago, the agency adopted enhanced pat-down searches for passengers at United States airports, a response to what it said were weaknesses in airport screening measures. Under the new rules, passengers will no longer be allowed to choose what type of searches they undergo in security lines.


As attack dogs go, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, is more labradoodle than Doberman, his partisanship disguised by a thick fur of intense preparation, modulated locution and gentle accusations.

So in a hearing on Monday of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Schiff, a doe-eyed former federal prosecutor, politely probed James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and carefully laid out the history of the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russian officials. It was a performance that showed how an avalanche of information can leverage the limited power of the minority party to damage a president.

“His public style of questioning is very similar to his nonpublic style of interacting with colleagues,” said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and another former prosecutor who as chairman of the committee investigating the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, was known for his pointed, even excitable style. “The courtroom is different from a committee hearing room in almost every way, but Adam has managed to make the transition well.”

In the hearing, Mr. Schiff successfully pressed Mr. Comey to say that the F.B.I. had no evidence to support President Trump’s claim that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had tapped his phones in Trump Tower. Soon afterward, Mr. Comey confirmed what had been widely reported before Monday: The F.B.I. is investigating whether members of Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election, an admission that took Mr. Schiff by surprise, he said.

It is a technique Mr. Schiff has employed repeatedly from his post as ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, where he has pressed for a congressional authorization of military force against the Islamic State, and as a member of the Benghazi committee, where he tried to steer the investigation away from the role of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the attack on the American government compound.

“It’s a challenge,” Mr. Schiff said. “In the minority you don’t have the power of subpoena. You have the power of relationships and the ability to shine the public spotlight on issues, but you have to use that leverage judiciously.”

Mr. Schiff, who represents a northern swath of Los Angeles County, helped found the Democratic Study Group on National Security in 2003 to go deep into national security concerns. He minors in transportation, as the author of the Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act.

Youthful, with a ruddy and cheerful visage, Mr. Schiff, 56, whose wife is actually named Eve, comes off like the guy who in high school talked to his prom date’s mother in the kitchen about the goings-on at the community garden.

But when he wants to hit, he does. On Monday morning, Mr. Schiff poked at Mr. Trump on Twitter, where the president had retreated to make pre-emptive attacks on the hearing, one of the few that congressional Republicans have staged to air evidence of Russian tampering with the election.

Mr. President, the Russians hacked our election and interfered. No one disputes this now, but you. This is what is called "fact". https://t.co/izJhR5xRrf

As the hearing opened, Mr. Schiff moved to paint Mr. Trump’s campaign as repeatedly in collusion with Russian officials, a possibility Mr. Comey conceded is now the subject of a federal investigation.

“Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence?” Mr. Schiff said. “Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated and that the Russians use the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don’t know, not yet. And we owe it to the country to find out.”

With that, Mr. Schiff elicited responses from Mr. Comey and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, by pressing them on whether the president’s Twitter messages and the statements by his aides to defend them had damaged America’s relations with allies like Britain and Germany.

Admiral Rogers concurred with a strenuous denial by the British government that the Obama administration had asked its intelligence service Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, to carry out surveillance of Trump Tower. He also acknowledged that it complicated America’s relationship with Germany to have Mr. Trump refer publicly to the Obama administration’s eavesdropping on Chancellor Angela Merkel, an operation that was made public by Edward J. Snowden.

Mr. Schiff, who was born in Massachusetts, was raised by a Democratic father and a Republican mother, and he has a photo in his office of his grandfather posing with President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Henry Cabot Lodge. A graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law School, Mr. Schiff was a United States attorney in Los Angeles, where he convicted the first F.B.I. agent indicted for espionage in an old-style Cold War case involving a honey trap named Svetlana. Before being elected to Congress, he served in the California State Legislature.

Mr. Schiff has a son in middle school and a daughter at Northwestern University, and he moved his family to Washington in 2003. He alternates from family-only weekends to heavy work weekends, often spent in California, where he is thought to be considering a Senate run should Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, decide not to seek another term.

For now, Mr. Schiff is focused on all things Trump. “I don’t think any of us can say where the investigation will conclude,’’ Mr. Schiff said. “It is very much in the public interest that we try to find out.’’  It was July 2014 when the Syrian defector, using the pseudonym Caesar, last slipped into Washington. Wearing a hood to hide his identity, the defector, a former Syrian police photographer, explained to a congressional committee how he had smuggled photographs out of the country that documented how thousands of Syrians had perished in President Bashar al-Assad’s prisons.

Caesar had hoped the revelation would spur the Obama administration to take action against Mr. Assad, and he has acknowledged that he was bitterly disappointed when the United States and its allies refrained from intervening.

Undaunted, Caesar and a fellow defector, a relative who identified himself as Sami, have returned to make a fresh appeal to a new commander in chief. Caesar is scheduled to go to the White House this week to urge President Trump’s advisers to follow through on a pledge to establish safe zones in Syria and take other steps to assist the Syrian opposition.

“We are hopeful that President Trump will do what President Obama refused to do,” Sami said. “I do not believe the time is too late.”

The two defectors, who live in an undisclosed location abroad, made their case on Monday to small group of human rights experts and reporters in a private meeting at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and in a brief interview afterward. Neither photographs nor recordings of the session were allowed, to help protect their identity. They and their extended family are presumed to be at risk from the Syrian government and its agents.

The Syrian conflict marks a grim anniversary on March 15, as the country enters its seventh year of civil war. The past year has been the deadliest for children since the conflict began, according to Unicef.

Caesar has supporters in Congress, but whether he will be able to make inroads with the Trump administration is far from clear. The defectors spoke Monday with Michael Ratney, who has served as the United States’ envoy on the Syria crisis, and they are scheduled to meet this week with senior aides at the National Security Council.

But no meeting has been set with Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, or with the top echelons of the State Department or Pentagon.

In a retrospective moment, the two defectors said they did not regret taking enormous risks to spirit the photos out of Syria — even though they had discovered that the international community was better at expressing outrage than agreeing on measures to quell the fighting and to press for a more inclusive government that did not include Mr. Assad.

For years, Caesar explained, his duties as a police photographer required him to document bodies that were often battered beyond recognition, a gruesome procedure mandated by the Syrian government. Determined to expose the torture and killing to the world, he smuggled thumb drives with the digital photos in his shoes and socks as he passed through government checkpoints.

Nor was the government the only worry, he said. For a while, the opposition Free Syrian Army had controlled much of his neighborhood, and Caesar had been afraid that he would be in danger if the rebels found out he worked for the police. He handled that risk by making a fake civilian ID.

By the end of 2013, he said, he had enough photos to document the murder and torture of more than 11,000 people and was ready to flee and make the evidence known. Caesar said his greatest worry was that the government would retaliate against his extended family.

“My life is not more valuable than the many who are being killed inside the country,” he said. “I died a hundred times a day. Looking at those bodies broke my heart.”

Navigating American policy on Syria has not been easy for the two defectors. While Mr. Obama declared that the Assad regime had lost the legitimacy to lead the nation and authorized a covert program to assist Syrian rebels, he was reluctant to take more direct action to compel the Syrian president to hand over power.

The Trump administration has neither spoken out forcefully on the Syria crisis nor promised fresh action, beyond a pledge to establish safe zones to try to stem the flow of Syrian refugees.

Mr. Trump indicated during the campaign that he has little interest in confronting Mr. Assad and has flirted with the idea of partnering with Russia, one of the Syrian government’s main backers, to press the military campaign against the Islamic State. At the same time, however, Mr. Trump’s vow to establish safe zones has given the defectors something of an opening.

Establishing safe zones in the northern and southern parts of the country would do much to mitigate the suffering of the Syrians who oppose Mr. Assad, Sami said.

American lawmakers, meanwhile, have been promoting legislation that would impose sanctions on anyone who provides financing or does business with the Assad government, which has also given the defectors a measure of hope. The legislation also calls for an assessment of how to set up safe zones or no-fly zones, and for an investigation of war crimes.

“The United States does not need to send troops,” Sami said. “It could sanction the Central Bank of Syria.”
